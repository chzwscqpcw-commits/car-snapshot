If you're taking your car off the road — whether for storage, repairs, or because you don't need it for a while — you need to declare a SORN. It's a legal requirement, and failing to do so can result in automatic fines from the DVLA.

Here's how to do it and what the rules are.

## What is a SORN?

A SORN (Statutory Off Road Notification) is a declaration to the DVLA that your vehicle is not being used or kept on a public road. Once a SORN is in place:

- You **don't need to pay road tax** (VED)
- You **don't need an MOT** (but the vehicle must have one before returning to the road if it's over 3 years old)
- You **cannot drive the vehicle on any public road** — not even briefly
- You **still need insurance** if you want protection against theft or damage while stored (but you are not legally required to insure a SORN'd vehicle kept on private land)

A SORN lasts indefinitely. It stays in place until you tax the vehicle again, sell it, scrap it, or export it.

## When do you need a SORN?

You need to declare a SORN if:

- **Your road tax expires and you're not renewing** — If your tax lapses and the vehicle is on private land, you must SORN it to avoid penalties.
- **You're storing a vehicle** — If the car is going into a garage or on a driveway and won't be used.
- **The vehicle needs repairs** — If it's off the road for major work and you don't want to keep paying tax.
- **You've bought a car that isn't taxed** — If you've bought a vehicle that's already SORN'd or untaxed, the SORN continues. You'll need to tax it before driving on public roads.

You can check whether a vehicle is currently taxed or SORN'd using our [tax check](/tax-check).

## How to SORN online — step by step

### 1. Go to the DVLA's online service

Visit the "Make a SORN" page on GOV.UK. You'll need the 11-digit reference number from your V5C (logbook).

### 2. Enter your details

You'll be asked for the vehicle registration number and the V5C reference number. If you don't have the V5C, you can still SORN by post (see below).

### 3. Confirm the SORN

Review the details and confirm. The SORN takes effect immediately.

### 4. Get a refund (if applicable)

If the vehicle is currently taxed, the DVLA will automatically refund any full remaining months of road tax. The refund is sent by cheque to the address on the V5C. You won't be refunded for the current month — only full months remaining after the SORN date.

The whole process takes about 5 minutes online.

## Other ways to SORN

- **By phone** — Call the DVLA on **0300 123 4321** (Monday to Friday, 8am–7pm; Saturday 8am–2pm). You'll need your V5C reference number.
- **By post** — Complete the SORN section on the V11 reminder letter (if you have one) and post it to the DVLA. Alternatively, write to: DVLA, Swansea, SA99 1AR with the registration number and V5C reference.

The online method is by far the quickest and gives instant confirmation.

## SORN rules you need to know

### You cannot drive on public roads — at all

Once a SORN is in place, the vehicle must not be driven or even parked on any public road. This includes:

- Driving to a garage for repairs
- Driving to an MOT test centre
- Parking on a public street outside your house

If you need to move the vehicle, you must either tax and insure it first, or transport it on a trailer or flatbed.

### You cannot drive to an MOT

Unlike an expired MOT (where you can drive directly to a pre-booked test), a SORN'd vehicle cannot be driven on public roads for any reason. If your vehicle needs an MOT before you can tax it, you'll need to arrange for a mobile tester to come to you, or transport the vehicle to the test centre.

### The vehicle must be on private land

A SORN'd vehicle must be kept on private property — a garage, driveway, private car park, or private land. If it's found on a public road, the DVLA can issue a penalty and have the vehicle clamped or removed.

### Tax does not transfer when you buy

If you buy a vehicle that is SORN'd, the SORN continues. You must tax it (and ensure it has a valid [MOT](/mot-check) if over 3 years old) before driving it on any public road.

### Penalties for not declaring a SORN

If your road tax expires and you haven't declared a SORN or renewed the tax, the DVLA will issue an automatic penalty of **£80** (reduced to £40 if paid within 33 days). They may also clamp or remove the vehicle if it's found on a public road.

## When to end a SORN

A SORN ends automatically when you:

- **Tax the vehicle** — Pay for road tax online, by phone, or at the Post Office
- **Sell the vehicle** — The new keeper takes responsibility for taxing or SORN-ing it
- **Scrap the vehicle** — Through an Authorised Treatment Facility
- **Export the vehicle** — Notify the DVLA that the vehicle is leaving the UK

Before ending a SORN by taxing the vehicle, make sure it has a valid MOT (if over 3 years old). You can check this using our [MOT check](/mot-check). The DVLA won't let you tax without a valid MOT.

## SORN and insurance

You are **not legally required** to insure a SORN'd vehicle. However:

- If the vehicle is stolen from your property, you won't be covered unless you have insurance
- If the vehicle is damaged by fire, flood, or vandalism, you won't be covered
- Some mortgage or property insurance policies exclude vehicles

Many insurers offer cheaper "laid-up" or "off-road" policies for SORN'd vehicles. If the car has any value, it's worth considering.

## The bottom line

Declaring a SORN is quick, free, and straightforward. If your vehicle is coming off the road for any reason, do it online in 5 minutes to avoid automatic penalties. When you're ready to put it back on the road, check the [MOT status](/mot-check) and [tax status](/tax-check) first, then tax it before turning a wheel on a public road.
