Buying your first car is exciting, but it can also be overwhelming. There's a lot to think about beyond just the car itself — insurance, tax, MOT, running costs, and a long list of things that can go wrong if you don't do your homework.

This checklist covers everything you need to know before and after buying your first car.

## Before you buy

### 1. Set a realistic budget

Your budget isn't just the purchase price. Factor in:

- **Insurance** — This is often the biggest cost for new drivers. Expect to pay £1,000–£2,500+ per year depending on the car, your age, and your location.
- **Road tax (VED)** — Varies by vehicle. Some cars cost nothing; others cost hundreds per year. Check before you buy using our [tax checker](/tax-check).
- **Fuel** — Budget roughly £100–£200 per month depending on how much you drive.
- **MOT** — Around £55 per year (the maximum fee), plus any repair costs if it fails.
- **Servicing** — At least one service per year, typically £150–£300.
- **Tyres, brakes, and wear items** — Budget £300–£500 per year as a contingency.

A car that costs £3,000 to buy might cost £4,000–£5,000 per year to run. Make sure you can afford both.

### 2. Get insurance quotes first

Before falling in love with a specific car, get insurance quotes for it. Insurance for new drivers is expensive, and the difference between models can be enormous. A car in insurance group 3 might cost £1,200 to insure, while a similar car in group 15 could cost £2,500+.

Generally, the cheapest cars to insure for new drivers are:

- Small engine (1.0–1.2 litre)
- Low insurance group (1–10)
- Not modified
- Common makes with cheap parts (Vauxhall, Ford, Volkswagen, Toyota)

Get quotes from comparison sites before you commit to any car.

### 3. Run a vehicle check

Before you go to see any car, look up the registration number. A [free car check](/car-check) will show you:

- **MOT history** — Has it been well maintained? Any recurring problems?
- **Tax status** — Is it currently taxed? What will it cost to tax?
- **Mileage records** — Does the [mileage history](/mileage-check) add up, or are there signs of clocking?
- **Vehicle details** — Does the advert match the official records?

This takes two minutes and can save you from a wasted trip — or worse, buying a problem car.

### 4. Check the MOT history carefully

The [MOT history](/mot-check) is your best window into how a car has been treated. Look for:

- **Regular annual tests** — Shows the car has been used and maintained consistently
- **Advisories that get addressed** — A good sign of responsible ownership
- **Frequent failures** — A car that fails every year has been neglected
- **Mileage progression** — Steady and consistent is what you want

A clean MOT history doesn't guarantee a perfect car, but it's a strong indicator of how the previous owner looked after it.

### 5. Inspect and test drive

When you see the car in person:

- Check the bodywork for rust, dents, and mismatched paint
- Look at the tyres — tread depth, even wear, matching brands
- Start it from cold and listen for unusual noises
- Test drive on different roads — listen for knocks, check the brakes, feel the steering
- Check all the electrics — lights, windows, wipers, heater

If you're not confident assessing a car yourself, take someone who knows cars, or pay for an independent inspection (£100–£200 from the AA or RAC).

## After you buy

### 6. Tax the vehicle

Car tax doesn't transfer with a sale. You **must** tax the vehicle in your name before driving it on a public road. The previous owner's tax will be cancelled and refunded to them automatically.

You can tax online through the DVLA website. You'll need the V5C (logbook) reference number or the green slip from the logbook.

### 7. Insure the vehicle

You must have at least third-party insurance to drive on a public road. Make sure your insurance is active before you drive the car away. Many insurers let you start a policy immediately online or over the phone.

For new drivers, consider:

- **Telematics (black box) insurance** — Often significantly cheaper for young drivers. A device monitors your driving and adjusts your premium based on how you actually drive.
- **Adding a named driver** — Having an experienced driver on your policy can reduce the premium (but you must be the main driver if it's your car — "fronting" is illegal).

### 8. Register it in your name

Complete the V5C logbook to transfer ownership. The seller gives you the green "new keeper" slip, and you update the details online or by post. The DVLA will send you a new V5C in your name within a few weeks.

### 9. Book a service

If there's no recent service history, book a service as soon as possible. Fresh oil, filters, and a check of all the vital components will give you peace of mind and a baseline for future maintenance.

### 10. Know when your MOT is due

If the car is over three years old, it needs an annual MOT. Check the [expiry date](/mot-check) and set a calendar reminder for a month before. You can get your MOT done up to a month early without losing any time on the certificate.

## Common first-car mistakes to avoid

**Buying on emotion** — It's easy to fall in love with the first car you see. View at least three options before deciding.

**Ignoring running costs** — A £2,000 car with £2,500 insurance and £400 road tax is more expensive than a £3,000 car with £1,200 insurance and zero tax.

**Skipping the checks** — Every car looks fine in photos. Always check the [MOT history](/mot-check), [mileage records](/mileage-check), and [tax status](/tax-check) before viewing.

**Not budgeting for repairs** — Used cars need maintenance. Keep a contingency fund of at least £500 for unexpected repairs.

**Modifying too soon** — Modifications almost always increase insurance costs, sometimes dramatically. Hold off until you've built up some no-claims bonus.

## The bottom line

Buying your first car should be exciting, not stressful. Do your research, run the checks, set a realistic budget, and don't rush into anything. A few hours of homework before you buy can save you thousands in the long run.

Start with a [free car check](/car-check) on any vehicle you're considering — it's the single most useful thing you can do before viewing a car.
