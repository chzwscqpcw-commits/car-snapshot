Taxing a car in the UK is straightforward — it takes about five minutes online and you can do it from your phone. But there are a few things you need to have ready, and some common situations (like buying a car or losing your V5C) that catch people out.

Here's everything you need to know.

## How to tax a car online

### What you'll need

You need **one** of the following:

- **V5C (logbook)** — The 11-digit reference number from the latest V5C/2 (the green "new keeper" supplement)
- **V11 reminder letter** — The reference number from the DVLA's tax renewal reminder, posted to you before your tax expires
- **V62 application** — If you've applied for a new V5C, you can use the V62 reference to tax the vehicle while waiting

You'll also need a valid payment method (debit card, credit card, or direct debit for monthly/six-monthly payments).

### Step-by-step

1. **Go to the DVLA's tax service** at gov.uk/vehicle-tax
2. **Enter your reference number** from the V5C, V11, or V62
3. **Confirm the vehicle details** — make sure the make, model, and registration match
4. **Choose your payment method** — pay for 12 months, 6 months (5% surcharge), or monthly by direct debit (5% surcharge)
5. **Complete payment** — you'll receive a confirmation email

That's it. There's no physical tax disc — vehicle tax has been fully digital since October 2014. The DVLA's database is updated immediately and can be checked by police via ANPR cameras.

## How much does car tax cost?

The cost depends on when your car was first registered and its CO2 emissions:

### Cars registered after 1 April 2017

| First-year rate | Based on CO2 emissions (0g/km = £0, up to £2,745 for 255+ g/km) |
|---|---|
| Standard rate (year 2+) | £190/year for all non-zero emission vehicles |
| Premium supplement | Extra £410/year for cars with a list price over £40,000 (for years 2–6) |
| Zero emission | £0 first year, then £190/year from April 2025 |

### Cars registered between March 2001 and March 2017

These pay a rate based on CO2 emission bands, ranging from £0 (Band A, up to 100 g/km) to £695 (Band M, 255+ g/km).

### Cars registered before March 2001

A flat rate based on engine size: £200 for engines up to 1,549cc, or £325 for 1,550cc and above.

## Can you tax a car without a V5C?

Yes, in some circumstances:

### If you've just bought the car

If the seller has given you the V5C/2 (the green "new keeper" slip), you can use the reference number on that to tax the vehicle online. You should receive the full V5C in your name within 2–4 weeks.

### If you've lost the V5C

Apply for a replacement V5C using a V62 form (available at Post Offices or online). The fee is £25. You can tax the vehicle using the V62 reference number while waiting for the new V5C.

### If the V11 reminder arrived

If you received the V11 tax renewal letter, you can use that reference to tax online even without the V5C in hand.

## What happens if you don't tax your car?

Driving an untaxed vehicle is illegal and can result in:

- **£80 late licensing penalty** — The DVLA can issue this automatically if your tax lapses and you haven't declared SORN
- **£1,000 fine** — Maximum penalty if the case goes to court
- **Vehicle clamped or impounded** — DVLA enforcement agents can clamp untaxed vehicles on public roads. Release costs £100 plus backdated tax. If not released within 24 days, the vehicle is crushed.
- **ANPR detection** — Police and DVLA use Automatic Number Plate Recognition cameras across the UK. Untaxed vehicles are flagged automatically.

The DVLA's enforcement is automated and effective. Don't assume you won't get caught — ANPR cameras are everywhere.

Check your current tax status at any time with our [tax check](/tax-check).

## Taxing a newly purchased car

This is where many people trip up. When a vehicle is sold, **the existing tax does not transfer to the new owner**. The seller receives a refund for any remaining full months, and the buyer must tax the vehicle in their own name before driving it.

This means:

1. **You cannot drive the car home without taxing it first** (unless you drive it directly to a pre-booked MOT)
2. **Tax it immediately** using the V5C/2 green slip from the seller
3. **Make sure the MOT is valid** — you cannot tax a vehicle without a valid [MOT](/mot-check) (if the car is over 3 years old)

If you're buying privately, sort the tax out before you collect the car. If you're buying from a dealer, they should handle this as part of the handover.

## Can you tax a car without an MOT?

No — with one exception. The DVLA's online system checks the MOT database and will not allow you to tax a vehicle with an expired MOT (if the car requires one, i.e. it's over 3 years old).

The exception is that you can **drive an untaxed vehicle directly to a pre-booked MOT appointment** at a testing station. This is the only legal journey you can make in an untaxed, un-MOT'd vehicle.

Check your MOT status and expiry date with our [MOT check](/mot-check).

## Paying by direct debit

Since 2014, you can pay monthly or every six months by direct debit instead of paying the full annual amount upfront. This is convenient but costs 5% more overall.

| Payment Method | Cost for £190 Standard Rate |
|---|---|
| Annual (one payment) | £190.00 |
| Six-monthly (two payments) | £99.75 × 2 = £199.50 |
| Monthly (twelve payments) | £16.63 × 12 = £199.50 |

The 5% surcharge is the same whether you pay monthly or six-monthly. If you can afford the annual payment, it saves you roughly £10/year.

Direct debit payments auto-renew, so you won't accidentally let your tax lapse. This is worth considering if you've ever forgotten to renew.

## SORN: the alternative to taxing

If you're not using your car on public roads, you can declare a Statutory Off Road Notification (SORN) instead of taxing it. A SORN is free and lasts until you tax the vehicle again.

While SORN'd, the vehicle must be kept on private land — a driveway, garage, or private car park. It cannot be parked on a public road, even briefly.

SORN is useful if you're storing a car, doing a long-term restoration, or waiting for parts to arrive. You'll save the annual tax cost while the car is off the road.

## Common questions

### Can I tax my car at the Post Office?

Yes. Take your V5C or V11 to any Post Office that handles vehicle tax. You'll need to pay in full (no direct debit option). This is useful if you prefer face-to-face or don't have online access.

### Can someone else tax my car?

Yes, anyone can tax a vehicle online if they have the reference number and a payment method. The tax doesn't need to be paid by the registered keeper.

### My tax expired yesterday — am I in trouble?

Tax the vehicle immediately. The DVLA typically allows a brief grace period before issuing penalties, but there's no guaranteed window. The longer you leave it, the higher the risk of a fine or ANPR detection.

### Does car tax transfer with a private plate?

If you transfer a private plate, the vehicle's tax status is unaffected. Tax is linked to the vehicle, not the registration number.

## The bottom line

Taxing a car online takes five minutes and costs nothing beyond the tax itself. The key things to remember are: you need a valid MOT first, tax doesn't transfer when a car is sold, and driving without tax risks automatic fines and clamping.

Check your [tax status](/tax-check) and [MOT status](/mot-check) with our [free car check](/car-check) to make sure everything is in order. If your tax is due for renewal, head to gov.uk/vehicle-tax and get it done today.
