Mileage fraud — commonly known as clocking — is still one of the most common types of used car fraud in the UK. Estimates suggest around 1 in 16 used cars on the market has had its odometer tampered with, costing buyers hundreds of millions of pounds every year.

The good news is that checking a vehicle's mileage history has never been easier. Here's how to do it and what to look for.

## Why mileage matters

Mileage directly affects a vehicle's value and condition. Higher-mileage cars have more wear on their engines, gearboxes, suspension, brakes, and interiors. A car with 30,000 miles is in fundamentally different condition to the same model with 130,000 miles, even if they look identical from the outside.

This is exactly why clocking happens. By winding back the odometer, a seller can make a high-mileage car appear to be a low-mileage bargain. The buyer pays more than the car is worth, and potentially faces expensive mechanical problems that wouldn't be expected at the displayed mileage.

## How to check mileage history

### MOT records

Every MOT test records the vehicle's odometer reading. Since MOT tests happen annually (for cars over three years old) and records go back to 2005, this creates a mileage timeline across the life of the vehicle.

You can check this timeline instantly by entering the registration number on our [free mileage checker](/mileage-check). You'll see every recorded reading, making it easy to spot any discrepancies.

### What to look for

**Consistent progression** — A normal mileage history shows a steady increase of roughly 7,000 to 10,000 miles per year. The figure should go up by a similar amount between each MOT. Some variation is normal — a year with a long commute might show 15,000 miles, while a year working from home might show 4,000 — but the general trend should be upward and broadly consistent.

**Drops in mileage** — This is the clearest red flag. If the mileage recorded at one MOT is lower than the previous year, the odometer has almost certainly been tampered with. Mileage cannot go backwards on a correctly functioning odometer. Any drop should be treated as a serious warning.

**Sudden large changes** — If a car goes from averaging 8,000 miles a year to suddenly showing 25,000 miles in one year, it's worth questioning. It could be legitimate (a new job with a long commute), but combined with other factors, it might suggest the odometer was corrected after a previous manipulation.

**Suspiciously low lifetime mileage** — A 15-year-old car with only 20,000 miles on the clock sounds appealing, but it's unusual. Very low mileage on older cars can indicate either genuine limited use (which brings its own problems — seized components, perished rubber, stale fluids) or odometer fraud.

## Other ways to verify mileage

### Service history

If the seller has a service history — whether a stamped book or a folder of invoices — check the mileage recorded at each service against the MOT records. They should broadly match. If the service book shows 60,000 miles at a service date but the MOT closest to that date shows 40,000, something doesn't add up.

### Physical wear

Compare the displayed mileage with the physical condition of the car:

- **Steering wheel and gear knob** — These show wear quickly. A car claiming 20,000 miles shouldn't have a heavily worn steering wheel.
- **Pedal rubbers** — Worn-through pedal rubbers suggest heavy use. New pedal rubbers on an older car could mean they've been replaced to disguise high mileage.
- **Seat bolsters** — The outer edges of the driver's seat wear with repeated entry and exit. Heavy wear here on a supposedly low-mileage car is a red flag.
- **Interior buttons and switches** — Frequently used controls like indicator stalks, window switches, and radio buttons show wear that's hard to disguise.

A car that claims 30,000 miles but has the interior wear of a 130,000-mile car should set alarm bells ringing.

### Digital vs analogue odometers

Older cars with analogue (mechanical) odometers are easier to clock — it's a simple physical process. Digital odometers are harder but far from impossible. Specialist tools can reprogram the mileage stored in the car's electronic control unit (ECU), and these tools are widely available online for relatively little money.

This is why MOT records are so valuable. Even if the odometer has been reprogrammed, the historical readings recorded at each MOT cannot be altered.

## What to do if you suspect clocking

If you find a mileage discrepancy when checking a car you're considering buying:

1. **Walk away.** The simplest and safest option. If the mileage history doesn't add up, there are plenty of other cars to choose from.
2. **Challenge the seller.** Ask them directly about the discrepancy. A legitimate explanation is possible (for example, if the odometer was replaced after a fault and reset to zero), but they should be able to provide documentation.
3. **Get a professional inspection.** An independent vehicle inspector can assess whether the physical condition of the car matches the claimed mileage.

If you've already bought a car and discover it was clocked:

1. **Report it to Trading Standards** — Mileage fraud is a criminal offence under the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008.
2. **Contact Citizens Advice** — They can help you understand your rights and options for recovering your money.
3. **Speak to the seller** — If you bought from a dealer, you have stronger legal protections under the Consumer Rights Act 2015.

## How mileage affects value

Mileage is one of the biggest factors in a used car's value. As a rough guide:

- **Below average mileage** (under 8,000 miles per year) adds value
- **Average mileage** (8,000–10,000 miles per year) is neutral
- **Above average mileage** (over 10,000 miles per year) reduces value

However, a high-mileage car with full service history and clean [MOT results](/mot-check) can be worth more than a low-mileage car with patchy records. Condition and documentation matter as much as the number on the odometer.

If you're curious what a vehicle is worth given its actual mileage, our [free car valuation tool](/car-valuation) factors in mileage automatically.

## The bottom line

Checking mileage takes less than a minute and it's one of the most important things you can do before buying a used car. The [mileage history](/mileage-check) from MOT records gives you an independent, tamper-proof timeline of the vehicle's odometer readings over its entire life.

If the numbers add up, you can buy with confidence. If they don't, you've just saved yourself from a potentially very expensive mistake.
