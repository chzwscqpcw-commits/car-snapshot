Private number plates are big business in the UK. Whether you've bought a personalised registration, inherited one, or want to move a plate between your own vehicles, the process involves the DVLA and a few steps that need to be followed correctly.

Here's exactly how to transfer a private plate, what it costs, and what to watch out for.

## What counts as a private plate?

A private (or personalised) number plate is any registration number that has been purchased or assigned outside the standard sequential system. This includes:

- **Prefix-style plates** — e.g. A1 ABC
- **New-style plates** — e.g. AB12 CDE
- **Dateless plates** — e.g. ABC 1 or 1 ABC (the most valuable, as they don't indicate an age)
- **Cherished plates** — Plates with personal significance, like initials or words

The key rule is that a registration number **must not make the vehicle appear newer than it actually is**. You can put an older plate on a newer car, but not a newer plate on an older car. For example, a "72" plate (2022) cannot go on a car first registered in 2018.

## How to transfer a plate between vehicles

### What you'll need

- **Both vehicles must be registered in the UK** and available for inspection if required
- **Both vehicles must be taxed or have a SORN** — you cannot transfer to or from an untaxed vehicle (unless it's SORN'd)
- **Both vehicles need a valid MOT** (if over 3 years old) — check this first using our [MOT check](/mot-check)
- **The V5C (logbook)** for the vehicle the plate is currently on
- **£80 transfer fee** payable to the DVLA

### Step-by-step process

**1. Check both vehicles are eligible**

Before starting, verify that both vehicles are taxed (or SORN'd) and have valid MOTs. Use our [tax check](/tax-check) and [MOT check](/mot-check) to confirm. The DVLA will reject the transfer if either vehicle fails these requirements.

**2. Fill in the application**

You can apply online through the DVLA's "Assign a personalised registration number" service, or by completing form V317 and posting it.

The online route is quicker — most transfers are processed within a few days. The postal route can take several weeks.

**3. Pay the fee**

The DVLA charges **£80** for each transfer. This fee applies whether you're moving a plate between your own vehicles or assigning it to someone else's vehicle.

**4. Receive the new documents**

After the transfer is processed, the DVLA will issue:

- An updated V5C for each vehicle showing the new registration numbers
- A new tax disc (if applicable, though physical discs were abolished in 2014, the digital record is updated)

**5. Update your number plates**

You are legally required to display the new registration number on your vehicle's physical plates. Order new plates from a registered number plate supplier — they will need to see your V5C or a retention certificate as proof of entitlement.

## How to put a plate on retention

If you're selling a vehicle but want to keep the private plate, you can put it on retention with the DVLA. This means the plate is held in your name without being assigned to any vehicle.

### Retention details

- **Cost:** £80 per application
- **Duration:** The plate is held for 10 years
- **Renewal:** You can renew for further 10-year periods at no extra cost
- **Usage:** You can assign the plate to a vehicle at any time during the retention period (another £80 fee applies)

### How to apply for retention

1. Apply online through the DVLA's "Keep a personalised registration number" service, or use form V317
2. Pay the £80 fee
3. The DVLA will issue a V778 retention certificate and assign a standard age-related registration to the vehicle

### Important: do this before selling the car

If you sell a vehicle with a private plate still on it, the plate goes with the vehicle. The new owner will receive the V5C with the private plate, and you lose all rights to it. Always apply for retention **before** the sale is completed.

## Buying a private plate

If you're buying a personalised registration from a dealer or private seller, make sure:

- **The seller has a V750 certificate of entitlement** (for unassigned plates) or **a V778 retention certificate** (for plates held on retention)
- **The plate is legitimately available** — Check with the DVLA if you're unsure
- **You factor in the £80 assignment fee** on top of the purchase price
- **The plate won't make your vehicle appear newer** than its actual age

Private plates range in price from under £200 for common combinations to millions for desirable dateless plates. The DVLA itself sells plates through auctions and its online shop.

## Common mistakes to avoid

**Forgetting to transfer before selling a car** — Once the vehicle is sold, the plate goes with it. Always apply for retention before completing the sale.

**Not checking MOT and tax status** — The DVLA requires both vehicles to be taxed (or SORN'd) with valid MOTs. A lapsed MOT will block the transfer. Check status with our [free car check](/car-check) before applying.

**Displaying plates before the V5C is updated** — It's illegal to display a registration number that doesn't match the vehicle's official records. Wait for the updated V5C before changing the physical plates.

**Using a non-registered plate supplier** — Number plates must be made by a RNPS (Registered Number Plate Supplier). They're legally required to verify your identity and entitlement before making plates.

**Illegal plate formatting** — Plates must conform to the standard font, spacing, and size. Altering spacing to spell words, using non-standard fonts, or adding decorative elements is illegal and can result in a £1,000 fine and MOT failure.

## What it costs — summary

| Action | Fee |
|--------|-----|
| Transfer a plate between vehicles | £80 |
| Put a plate on retention | £80 |
| Assign a plate from retention to a vehicle | £80 |
| Renew a retention (every 10 years) | Free |

All fees are payable to the DVLA. If buying a plate from a dealer, the purchase price is separate from these DVLA fees.

## The bottom line

Transferring a private plate is straightforward once you understand the process — it's essentially an £80 application to the DVLA. The most important things are to check that both vehicles meet the [MOT](/mot-check) and [tax](/tax-check) requirements before applying, and to put plates on retention before selling a vehicle.

Start by running a [free car check](/car-check) on both vehicles to confirm their status, then apply online through the DVLA for the fastest processing.
