"Have you done an HPI check?" is one of the most common questions in any used car transaction. HPI has become a generic term — like Hoover for vacuum cleaners — but it refers to a specific product, and understanding what it does (and doesn't) cover helps you decide whether you need one.

Here's a straightforward comparison of free car checks versus paid checks like HPI.

## What does an HPI check actually cover?

HPI Check is a paid vehicle history report that queries multiple databases. A standard HPI check includes:

- **Outstanding finance** — Whether the car has money owed on it through a hire purchase, PCP, or lease agreement. If you buy a car with outstanding finance, the finance company can repossess it.
- **Insurance write-off status** — Whether the vehicle has been written off (Cat A, B, S, or N) by an insurance company.
- **Stolen vehicle check** — A query against the Police National Computer (PNC) to see if the vehicle has been reported stolen.
- **Mileage discrepancies** — Comparison against the National Mileage Register and MOT records to flag potential clocking.
- **Number of previous keepers** — How many registered owners the vehicle has had.
- **Plate changes** — Whether the registration number has been changed, which can sometimes be used to disguise a vehicle's history.
- **Scrapped marker** — Whether the vehicle has been recorded as scrapped by the DVLA.

An HPI check typically costs £10–£20 depending on the level of detail and any promotional offers.

## What does a free car check cover?

A [free car check](/car-check) queries publicly available DVLA and MOT data. With our free check, you get:

- **DVLA vehicle details** — Make, model, colour, engine size, fuel type, year of manufacture, CO2 emissions
- **Tax status** — Whether the vehicle is currently [taxed](/tax-check) or SORN'd, and when the tax expires
- **MOT status and history** — Current [MOT status](/mot-check), full test history with pass/fail results, advisories, and failure reasons
- **Mileage history** — The [mileage recorded](/mileage-check) at every MOT test, making it easy to spot odometer tampering
- **ULEZ compliance** — Whether the vehicle meets [ULEZ requirements](/ulez-check)
- **Safety recalls** — Any [manufacturer recalls](/recall-check) that may apply to the vehicle
- **Vehicle valuation** — An estimated [market value](/car-valuation) based on age, mileage, and condition

This is a substantial amount of information — and it's genuinely free, with no sign-up required.

## What can a free check NOT tell you?

The key gaps in a free check are the things that require access to private databases:

### Outstanding finance

This is the biggest gap. Finance data is held by finance companies and shared through services like HPI and Experian. There is no free way to check this. Around 90% of new cars are bought on finance, so a significant proportion of used cars on the market may still have money owed.

**Why it matters:** If you buy a car with outstanding finance, the finance company — not the seller — legally owns it. They can repossess it, and you lose both the car and your money.

### Insurance write-off status

Write-off markers (Cat N, Cat S, etc.) are recorded by insurance companies and shared through paid databases. While a write-off can sometimes be inferred from MOT history (a gap in tests followed by a post-repair MOT), only a paid check gives a definitive answer.

### Stolen vehicle status

The PNC database is not publicly accessible. A free check cannot tell you whether a car has been reported stolen.

## When should you pay for an HPI check?

**Always pay for a check if:**

- **You're spending more than £2,000–£3,000** — The £15–£20 cost is trivial relative to the purchase price. Outstanding finance alone could cost you the entire value of the car.
- **You're buying privately** — Dealers are required to do basic checks and carry more legal liability. Private sellers have no such obligation.
- **Something feels off** — If the price seems too good, the seller is evasive about history, or the documentation is incomplete, a paid check is essential.
- **The car is relatively new** — Newer cars are more likely to have outstanding finance (especially PCP deals that run for 3–4 years).

**A free check may be sufficient if:**

- **You're buying a very cheap car** — A £500 runabout is unlikely to have significant outstanding finance, and the cost of a paid check is proportionally high.
- **You're buying from a franchised dealer** — Reputable dealers run their own checks and offer warranties. The risk is lower.
- **You just want to verify the basics** — MOT status, tax, mileage history, and vehicle details are all available for free.

## The smart approach: free first, then paid

The most cost-effective strategy is to use a free check as your first filter and a paid check as your final confirmation:

**Step 1:** Run a [free car check](/car-check) on every vehicle you're considering. This costs nothing and immediately reveals MOT issues, mileage discrepancies, tax problems, and recall history. If something looks wrong here, you can walk away without spending a penny.

**Step 2:** Once you've narrowed down to a car you're seriously interested in, pay for a full HPI or equivalent check before committing. This fills in the gaps around finance, write-off status, and stolen markers.

This approach means you only pay for a check on the car you actually intend to buy, rather than spending £15–£20 on every vehicle you browse.

## Alternatives to HPI

HPI is the best-known brand, but other services provide equivalent checks:

- **AA Vehicle Check** — Similar coverage to HPI, often bundled with AA membership offers
- **RAC Vehicle History Check** — Comparable product from the RAC
- **Experian AutoCheck** — Powered by one of the major credit agencies
- **Total Car Check** — Budget option with similar data sources

All query broadly the same databases. The core information (finance, write-off, stolen status) should be identical regardless of provider. Differences tend to be in presentation, additional features, and price.

## What no check can tell you

No vehicle history check — free or paid — can tell you about:

- **Mechanical condition** — Whether the engine, gearbox, or suspension are worn
- **Accident damage that wasn't claimed on insurance** — If damage was repaired privately without an insurance claim, there's no record
- **How the car was driven** — Hard driving, track use, or neglectful ownership
- **Future reliability** — Past history is a guide, not a guarantee

For these, you need a physical inspection. Consider an independent vehicle inspection from the AA or RAC (around £100–£200) for any significant purchase.

## The bottom line

A free car check gives you an impressive amount of information at no cost — [MOT history](/mot-check), [mileage verification](/mileage-check), [tax status](/tax-check), [ULEZ compliance](/ulez-check), [recall checks](/recall-check), and [valuation](/car-valuation). Use it as your first step on every car you consider.

For any purchase over a few thousand pounds, add a paid HPI or equivalent check to cover finance, write-off, and stolen status. The combination of free and paid checks gives you the most complete picture of a vehicle's history.
