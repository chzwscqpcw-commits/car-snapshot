Every MOT test result since 2005 is publicly available for any UK vehicle. It's one of the most useful free tools for understanding a car's condition and maintenance history — whether it's your own car or one you're thinking of buying.

But the information is only useful if you know what you're looking at. Here's how to read MOT history and spot the things that matter.

## Where to find MOT history

You can check any vehicle's MOT history by entering the registration number on [Free Plate Check's MOT history tool](/mot-check). You'll see every test result, including the date, mileage, result, and any advisories, failures, or defects recorded.

No signup is needed and it works for any UK-registered vehicle that's had an MOT.

## Understanding test results

Each MOT test will show one of these results:

- **Pass** — The vehicle met all the minimum standards on the day of the test.
- **Pass with advisories** — The vehicle passed, but the tester noted items that are showing wear or minor deterioration. These aren't failures, but they're worth monitoring.
- **Fail** — One or more components didn't meet the minimum standard. The vehicle can't be driven on the road (with limited exceptions) until the issues are fixed and it passes a retest.

Since May 2018, the system also categorises individual defects:

- **Minor** — Not serious enough to fail, but recorded for information. Similar to the old advisory system.
- **Major** — A more significant deficiency. The car fails.
- **Dangerous** — A serious safety risk. The car fails immediately and should not be driven.

## What the mileage tells you

Every MOT records the odometer reading. This creates a mileage timeline across the life of the car, and it's incredibly useful for spotting two things:

### Consistent mileage

A typical UK car does 7,000–10,000 miles per year. If you see roughly that amount added between each test, the car has been used normally. Higher mileage isn't necessarily bad — motorway miles are easier on a car than stop-start city driving — but it does affect wear and resale value.

### Mileage discrepancies

This is the big one. Look for:

- **A drop in mileage** between tests — This should never happen. If the mileage goes down, the odometer has likely been tampered with (clocked). This is illegal but still disturbingly common.
- **Unusually low annual mileage** — If a car suddenly goes from 10,000 miles a year to 2,000, it may have been sitting unused (which can cause its own problems — seized brakes, perished seals, flat-spotted tyres).
- **Suspiciously round numbers** — Not conclusive on its own, but combined with other flags, it's worth noting.

Mileage fraud is estimated to affect around 1 in 16 used cars sold in the UK. The MOT history is your best defence.

## How to spot a well-maintained car

A clean MOT history doesn't just mean "no failures." Look for patterns that indicate good ownership:

- **Consistent annual tests** — The car is tested roughly every 12 months, on time, without long gaps.
- **Advisories addressed between tests** — If an advisory appears one year and disappears the next, the owner fixed it. That's a good sign.
- **Low failure rate** — Cars that pass first time most years have generally been well looked after.
- **Mileage that adds up** — Steady, predictable mileage increase with no anomalies.

## Red flags to watch for

### Recurring advisories that never get fixed

If "brake discs worn" appears as an advisory for three consecutive years, the owner has been ignoring it. This is a car that's had the minimum spent on it.

### Frequent failures

Every car can fail an MOT occasionally — a blown bulb or a worn wiper blade is normal. But if a car fails year after year, especially for different things, it suggests ongoing neglect or underlying problems.

### Long gaps between tests

If there's a two-year gap in the MOT history, the car was either off the road (SORN'd) or driven illegally without an MOT. Neither is necessarily a dealbreaker, but it's worth asking about. Cars that sit unused for extended periods can develop problems — corroded brakes, perished rubber components, flat batteries, and stale fuel.

### A sudden change in testing station

This could be innocent — the owner moved house, for example. But if the car has been tested at the same garage for years and then suddenly switches to a different one, especially right before a sale, it's worth questioning why.

### Dangerous defects

These are rare but serious. If a vehicle has been flagged with a dangerous defect at any point in its history, investigate what it was and verify it was properly repaired.

## What MOT history can't tell you

MOT history is valuable, but it has limits:

- **It doesn't cover everything** — The MOT checks safety and emissions. It doesn't assess the engine's internal condition, gearbox health, or whether the air conditioning works.
- **It's a snapshot** — A pass means the car met the standard on that specific day. Things can deteriorate between tests.
- **It starts at three years old** — New cars don't need an MOT for the first three years, so you won't have history for that period.
- **It doesn't record repairs** — You can see what failed, but not how or where it was repaired. A cheap bodge fix and a proper repair look the same in the records.

## Making the most of MOT history

When reviewing a vehicle's history, don't just glance at pass or fail. Read the detail. Look at the mileage progression across every test. Note which advisories come and go, and which ones persist. Compare the condition of the car you're looking at with what the records suggest.

Combined with a visual inspection and a test drive, MOT history gives you a remarkably clear picture of how a car has been treated. It's free, it takes two minutes, and it could save you from an expensive mistake.
