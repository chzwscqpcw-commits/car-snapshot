Whether you're buying a used car, checking your own vehicle, or just curious about a car parked on your street, knowing how to check a vehicle's tax status is useful. In the UK, it's completely free and takes about 30 seconds.

Here's everything you need to know.

## How vehicle tax works in the UK

Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) — commonly called car tax or road tax — is a legal requirement for almost every vehicle used or kept on a public road in the UK. If your car isn't taxed and isn't declared SORN (Statutory Off Road Notification), you're breaking the law.

Since 2014, there's no physical tax disc. Everything is handled electronically by the DVLA, which means you can't tell whether a car is taxed just by looking at it. You need to check online.

## How to check a car's tax status

The simplest way is to enter the registration number into a [free tax status checker](/tax-check). You'll see the tax status straight away, along with other useful details like MOT status and vehicle specs.

You don't need to own the vehicle to check. Anyone can look up any UK-registered vehicle using just the number plate.

## What the tax statuses mean

When you check, you'll typically see one of these:

- **Taxed** — The vehicle is currently taxed and legal to drive on public roads. You'll usually see the expiry date too.
- **SORN** — The vehicle has been declared off the road. It's legal to keep on private land but cannot be driven or parked on any public road.
- **Untaxed** — The vehicle's tax has expired and no SORN has been declared. This is the problem status — it likely means the owner has forgotten to renew, or the vehicle has been abandoned.
- **Tax not due** — Some vehicles are exempt from VED. This includes certain historic vehicles (registered before 1 January 1977), electric vehicles on older tax bands, and diplomatic vehicles.

## Why does tax status matter?

### If you own the car

Driving without valid tax is an offence. You can be fined up to £1,000, and the DVLA can clamp or impound your vehicle. They also use automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) cameras across the country, so it's not something you can get away with quietly.

Set a reminder a few weeks before your tax is due. Unlike MOT, you can't renew car tax early — you need to wait until the final month.

### If you're buying a car

Car tax doesn't transfer with a vehicle sale. When you buy a car, you must tax it in your own name before driving it away. The seller's remaining tax gets cancelled and refunded to them automatically.

This catches a lot of buyers off guard. Even if the seller says "it's got six months of tax left," that tax will be cancelled the moment the DVLA processes the change of ownership. Don't assume you can drive it home untaxed — if you're stopped, it's your problem.

### If you're checking a parked or abandoned car

If a car on your street has been sitting untaxed for weeks, it may be abandoned. Local councils have the power to remove untaxed vehicles from public roads. An untaxed car is also a reasonable indicator that it's uninsured, which is a more serious legal issue.

## How much does car tax cost?

VED rates depend on several factors:

- **CO2 emissions** — Cleaner cars pay less. Zero-emission vehicles currently pay nothing in the first year, though this is changing.
- **Registration date** — Cars registered before April 2017 use a different (often cheaper) banding system based purely on CO2.
- **List price** — Cars with a list price over £40,000 pay an additional supplement for five years.
- **Fuel type** — Diesel vehicles that don't meet RDE2 standards pay a supplement in the first year.

For most cars registered after April 2017, the first year rate varies by emissions, then it drops to a flat standard rate (currently £190/year for petrol and diesel cars).

You can check exact rates on the GOV.UK website.

## Can you tax a car without an MOT?

No. To tax a vehicle, it must have a valid MOT certificate (unless it's exempt — for example, cars less than three years old or historic vehicles). The systems are linked, so if your MOT has expired, the DVLA won't let you tax it online.

This creates a practical issue: if your MOT and tax both expire, you need to get the MOT done first. But you can't legally drive to the MOT station without tax. The exception is that you can drive to a pre-booked MOT appointment even if the car is untaxed, as long as the test station is expecting you.

## Monthly vs annual payments

You can pay for car tax annually, every six months, or monthly by direct debit. Monthly payments cost slightly more overall (about 5% extra), but many people prefer spreading the cost. Six-monthly payments also carry a small premium.

If you pay monthly and miss a payment, the DVLA will cancel your tax and send you a late licensing penalty. It's one of those things that's easy to set up and forget, but worth keeping an eye on.

## The key takeaways

1. You can check any vehicle's tax status for free using just the registration number.
2. Tax doesn't transfer when a car is sold — the buyer must tax it themselves.
3. Driving untaxed can result in fines, clamping, or impounding.
4. You need a valid MOT before you can tax a vehicle.
5. Set a reminder before your tax is due — there's no grace period.

It's one of those quick checks that takes seconds but can save you from a costly mistake.
