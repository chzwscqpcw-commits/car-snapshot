  - question: "How do car valuations work?"
    answer: "Car valuations estimate your vehicle's market value based on factors including age, mileage, condition, make and model, service history, and current market demand. Online tools provide instant estimates using these data points combined with real listing data."
  - question: "What affects a car's value the most?"
    answer: "The main factors are age, mileage, condition, and service history. A car with full service history is typically worth 10–20% more than one without. The number of previous owners, colour, and whether it has been in an accident also affect value."
  - question: "How much does mileage affect car value?"
    answer: "Mileage has a significant impact. A car with lower-than-average mileage for its age will typically be worth more, while high-mileage vehicles are worth less. The average annual mileage in the UK is around 7,000–8,000 miles."

"How much is my car worth?" is one of the most common questions asked by UK car owners. Whether you're thinking about selling, negotiating a part-exchange, or just curious, knowing your vehicle's current market value puts you in a stronger position.

This guide explains how car valuations work, what factors affect your vehicle's value, and how to make the most of what you've got when it comes time to sell.

## How do car valuations work?

A car valuation estimates what your vehicle is worth on the open market. Most valuation tools — including [Free Plate Check's free valuation](/car-valuation) — use a combination of data points to arrive at a figure:

**Depreciation modelling** is the foundation. New cars lose value quickly — typically 15–35% in the first year alone. Depreciation slows as the vehicle ages but never fully stops. The rate varies significantly by make and model. Some brands (Toyota, Porsche, Tesla) hold their value well, while volume brands tend to depreciate faster.

**Mileage adjustment** refines the estimate. A car with lower-than-average mileage is worth more; a car with higher mileage is worth less. The UK average is around 8,000 miles per year, so a five-year-old car would typically show around 40,000 miles.

**Market data** provides the real-world check. By looking at similar vehicles currently for sale, a valuation tool can see what the market actually bears — not just what the depreciation model predicts. This is where listings data from used car platforms becomes valuable.

**Condition adjustments** account for the things data alone can't capture. Service history, bodywork condition, interior wear, number of previous owners, and accident history all affect the final figure. That's why most valuations show a range rather than a single number — and why tools like ours include a condition questionnaire to narrow it down.

## What affects a car's value?

Several factors combine to determine what a buyer will pay. Understanding these helps you set realistic expectations — and spot opportunities to add value before selling.

### Age and depreciation

Age is the single biggest factor. A new car loses the most value in its first three years, then the curve flattens. By the time a car is seven or eight years old, annual depreciation is relatively modest. Classic and collector vehicles can actually appreciate, but that's a different market entirely.

### Mileage

Lower mileage generally means higher value, but it's not as simple as "less is always better." A car with suspiciously low mileage and gaps in its [MOT history](/mot-check) may have been sitting unused — which brings its own problems (perished seals, flat-spotted tyres, battery degradation). Consistent [mileage progression](/mileage-check) through MOT records is what buyers want to see.

### Service history

A full service history — especially from main dealers — adds significant value. It proves the car has been maintained to the manufacturer's schedule and gives the buyer confidence that nothing has been neglected. Missing service records raise questions and reduce what buyers are willing to pay.

### MOT history

A clean MOT history with consistent passes and few advisories is a genuine selling point. Conversely, frequent failures and long advisory lists suggest the car has had problems. You can [check any vehicle's MOT history](/mot-check) on Free Plate Check for free.

### Number of previous owners

Fewer owners generally means better value retention. One-owner cars command a modest premium because they imply a more consistent ownership and maintenance history. By the time a car has had four or five owners, each for relatively short periods, buyers start to wonder why it kept changing hands.

### Colour

It matters more than most people think. Popular colours — black, white, grey, silver, blue — hold their value better than unusual choices. A bright green or orange car might appeal to a niche buyer, but the smaller pool of potential purchasers typically means a lower sale price.

### Specification and trim

Higher-spec trim levels and desirable options (leather seats, sat-nav, parking sensors, alloy wheels) add value, though rarely by as much as they cost when new. A base-spec model will always be worth less than a well-equipped version of the same car and age.

### Damage history

A vehicle that has been in an accident or recorded as an insurance write-off (categories S, N, B, or A) will be worth significantly less than an equivalent undamaged example. Even after professional repair, the history stays on the record and affects buyer confidence.

## Types of valuation

Not all valuations serve the same purpose. Here are the main types:

**Private sale valuation** — What you might expect to get selling directly to another person. This is usually the highest figure because there's no dealer margin involved. However, it takes more time and effort to sell privately.

**Trade-in / part-exchange valuation** — What a dealer would offer you against a new or used car purchase. This is typically the lowest figure because the dealer needs to make a profit when they resell. It's convenient but you'll get less than selling privately.

**Instant online valuation** — A quick estimate based on registration data, depreciation models, and market comparisons. This is what [Free Plate Check](/car-valuation) provides — no signup, no personal data required, just enter a reg and get an instant range. It's a useful starting point for understanding roughly what your car is worth.

**Professional / formal valuation** — An in-person inspection by a qualified assessor. This is typically required for insurance claims, finance settlements, or legal disputes. It's the most accurate but costs money and takes time.

## Tips for getting the best price when selling

If you've decided to sell, a few straightforward steps can help you maximise the price:

**Get an MOT before selling** — Even if the current MOT has months left, a fresh test gives the buyer confidence and removes one objection. If there are minor advisories, consider addressing them before the test.

**Gather your paperwork** — Full service history, MOT certificates, receipts for work done, the V5C logbook, and any warranty documentation. The more paperwork you can show, the more confidence the buyer has.

**Address obvious cosmetic issues** — You don't need to spend thousands on a full respray, but fixing minor scratches, dents, and scuffs can make a noticeable difference. A professional detail (interior and exterior clean) typically costs £100–£200 and can add considerably more than that to the sale price.

**Clean the car thoroughly** — This sounds basic but it matters. A clean, well-presented car photographs better, shows better in person, and gives the impression of a cared-for vehicle. Clean the engine bay too — buyers who lift the bonnet will notice.

**Price competitively** — Check what similar vehicles are listed for on AutoTrader, eBay Motors, and Facebook Marketplace. Price yours in line with the market rather than based on what you paid or what you feel it's worth. Use our [free valuation tool](/car-valuation) to get a data-driven starting point.

**Take good photos** — If listing online, clean the car first and photograph it in good light. Include all angles: front, rear, both sides, dashboard, odometer, boot, engine bay, and any imperfections. Honest, detailed photos build trust and attract serious buyers.

## When to get a valuation

A valuation is useful in several situations beyond just selling:

- **Buying a used car** — Check the asking price against the market to make sure you're not overpaying
- **Insurance claims** — Know your vehicle's market value before negotiating a settlement
- **Part-exchange negotiations** — Have a realistic figure in mind before the dealer makes their offer
- **Financial planning** — Understand the current value of your assets
- **Deciding whether to repair or sell** — If a repair bill is a significant fraction of the car's value, it may be time to move on
