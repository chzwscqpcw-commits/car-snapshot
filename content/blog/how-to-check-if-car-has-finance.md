One of the biggest risks when buying a used car privately is discovering — after you've handed over the cash — that the vehicle has outstanding finance on it. If it does, you may not legally own the car, and the finance company can repossess it.

Here's how to check for finance before you buy, and what to do if you find it.

## Why outstanding finance matters

When someone buys a car on finance (hire purchase, PCP, or a conditional sale agreement), the finance company owns the vehicle until the final payment is made. If the seller hasn't finished paying, the finance company still has a legal claim on the car.

This means:

- **You may not legally own the car** — Even if you paid the seller in full and received the V5C, the finance company retains ownership until the debt is settled.
- **The car can be repossessed** — The finance company can recover the vehicle at any time, leaving you with nothing.
- **Selling a financed car without settling the debt is illegal** — It's fraud under the Fraud Act 2006, but that doesn't help you get your money back.

Around a third of used cars in the UK are bought on some form of finance, so this is not a rare problem. It's one of the most common issues uncovered by vehicle history checks.

## How to check for outstanding finance

### Free checks (limited)

A [free car check](/car-check) will show you the vehicle's DVLA data, [MOT history](/mot-check), [tax status](/tax-check), and [mileage records](/mileage-check) — all useful for spotting other problems. However, **finance data is not available through free government APIs**. No free tool can tell you definitively whether a car has outstanding finance.

That said, free checks can still flag warning signs:

- **Recent registration changes** — Multiple keeper changes in a short period can indicate someone trying to offload a financed car quickly.
- **SORN status** — A vehicle that's been declared off the road may have been removed from use because of a finance dispute.
- **Low mileage for age** — Could indicate the vehicle has been sitting unused, possibly due to financial issues.

### Paid finance checks

For a definitive answer, you need a paid vehicle history check that queries finance databases. The main providers are:

- **HPI Check** (part of Cap HPI) — The most well-known. Checks for outstanding finance, insurance write-offs, stolen vehicle markers, and mileage discrepancies. Costs around £20.
- **AA Vehicle Check** — Similar coverage to HPI, powered by Experian data. Around £10–£20.
- **RAC Vehicle History Check** — Comparable to AA, includes finance and write-off data.
- **Experian AutoCheck** — Direct from the credit data provider.

These services query the main UK finance databases (HPI and Experian) where finance companies register their interest in vehicles. If a car has an active finance agreement, it should appear in these records.

### Ask the seller directly

Always ask the seller whether the vehicle has any outstanding finance. If they say no, ask them to confirm in writing. A legitimate private seller should have no problem with this.

If buying from a dealer, they are legally required to disclose outstanding finance under the Consumer Rights Act 2015. Reputable dealers will have already settled any finance before listing the vehicle for sale.

## What happens if you buy a car with finance on it?

### The finance company can repossess the car

Under the Hire Purchase Act 1964, if you buy a car that has outstanding hire purchase or conditional sale finance, and you buy in good faith without knowledge of the finance, you may be considered an "innocent purchaser" and gain good title to the vehicle. This only applies to:

- **Hire purchase or conditional sale agreements** — Not personal loans secured against the vehicle.
- **Private buyers** — Not dealers, who are expected to check.
- **Good faith** — You must not have known about the finance.

Even with this protection, proving "good faith" can be difficult and time-consuming. Prevention is far better than cure.

### Your options if it happens

If you discover you've bought a car with outstanding finance:

1. **Contact the seller** — Ask them to settle the finance immediately. If they refuse, this may constitute fraud.
2. **Contact the finance company** — Explain the situation. They may be willing to negotiate, especially if the seller has disappeared.
3. **Report it to the police** — If the seller knowingly sold a financed car without disclosing it, report it to Action Fraud (0300 123 2040).
4. **Seek legal advice** — You may have a claim against the seller under the Hire Purchase Act or through the small claims court.
5. **Contact Citizens Advice** — They can help you understand your rights and next steps.

## How to protect yourself

**Always run a paid finance check on high-value purchases.** The £10–£20 cost is insignificant compared to losing thousands on a financed car.

**Start with a free check.** Use our [free car check](/car-check) to verify the vehicle details, [MOT history](/mot-check), and [mileage](/mileage-check). If anything looks suspicious, that's your cue to investigate further before spending money on a paid check.

**Get everything in writing.** Ask the seller to confirm in writing that the vehicle is free from finance. Keep all receipts and correspondence.

**Pay by bank transfer, not cash.** This creates a paper trail. Never pay large sums in cash for a vehicle purchase.

**Check the V5C carefully.** Make sure the seller's name and address match the V5C. Be cautious if the V5C is very new (recently re-issued), as this can indicate a recent change of ownership connected to a finance dispute.

## The bottom line

Outstanding finance is one of the few risks that a free car check cannot fully cover — finance data sits in private databases, not government APIs. For any used car costing more than a few hundred pounds, spend £10–£20 on a paid HPI or AA check. It's the cheapest insurance you'll ever buy.

Start with a [free car check](/car-check) to cover everything else — vehicle details, MOT history, tax status, mileage, ULEZ compliance, and recalls. Then add a paid finance check for complete peace of mind.
