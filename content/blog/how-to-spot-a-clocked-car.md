Clocking — winding back a car's odometer to show fewer miles than it's actually done — is one of the most common scams in the UK used car market. It makes a vehicle look less worn, more valuable, and easier to sell at a higher price.

The problem is bigger than most people realise. According to industry estimates, around 1 in 16 used cars on UK roads has a clocked mileage. That's roughly 2.5 million vehicles. And because modern clocking is done digitally, there's no broken seal or obvious physical evidence to find.

Here's how to protect yourself.

## Why clocking matters

This isn't just about paying over the odds. A car with 120,000 miles on the clock has very different maintenance needs to one with 60,000 miles. Timing belts, clutches, suspension bushings, brake discs — these components wear out based on mileage. If the odometer says 60,000 but the car has really done 120,000, you could be driving a vehicle that's overdue for critical maintenance and doesn't handle or stop the way it should.

Clocked cars also tend to have shorter lifespans, higher repair bills, and significantly lower resale values once the true mileage comes to light.

## 1. Check the MOT mileage history

This is the single most effective check you can do, and it's completely free.

Every time a car has an MOT test, the garage records the odometer reading. These readings are stored by DVLA and go back to 2005. By looking at the full history, you can see whether the mileage has increased steadily over the years — or whether it's mysteriously dropped at some point.

A healthy mileage history looks like a steady upward line. If the mileage suddenly drops between two MOT tests — say from 87,000 miles down to 54,000 miles — that's a major red flag.

You can check this for free using [our mileage check tool](/mileage-check). Enter any UK registration number and you'll see every recorded MOT mileage reading in chronological order, with anomalies flagged automatically.

## 2. Calculate the average annual mileage

The average UK car covers roughly 7,000 to 10,000 miles per year. If a car is being advertised with suspiciously low mileage for its age, that doesn't necessarily mean it's been clocked — some cars genuinely are low-mileage — but it does mean you should investigate further.

A ten-year-old car showing 25,000 miles (2,500 per year) could be genuine if it was owned by someone who walked to work and only used it for weekend shopping. But it's unusual enough to warrant extra scrutiny.

Work out the average: total mileage divided by the car's age in years. If it's significantly below 5,000 miles per year, ask the seller for an explanation and check the MOT history to see if the annual readings support their story.

## 3. Look at the wear on the interior

The inside of a car tells a story that the odometer can't hide. A car that's genuinely done 30,000 miles should have an interior that looks almost new. If the steering wheel is shiny and worn smooth, the driver's seat bolster is sagging, the pedal rubbers are worn flat, or the gear knob is polished from use — but the odometer says low mileage — something doesn't add up.

Pay particular attention to:

- **The steering wheel** — heavy use leaves it shiny and smooth, especially at the 10-and-2 positions
- **The driver's seat** — look at the outer edge (bolster) where you slide in and out
- **Pedal rubbers** — badly worn or brand-new replacements on a "low mileage" car are both suspicious
- **The gear knob and handbrake** — these wear visibly with heavy use
- **Door cards and armrests** — scuffing and wear that doesn't match the claimed mileage

If any of these show significantly more wear than the mileage suggests, ask questions.

## 4. Check the service history

A genuine low-mileage car should have a service history that matches. Ask to see the service book and any invoices. Each service stamp or invoice should show the mileage at the time of the service, and these should increase consistently.

Watch for gaps in the service history. If the book shows services at 10,000, 20,000, and 30,000 miles — then nothing until the car appears for sale at 35,000 miles — those gaps could be where the clocking happened. The seller may have removed pages or "lost" invoices that showed higher mileage readings.

Also check whether the service stamps are from the same garage or at least from garages in the same area. A car that was serviced in Glasgow, then Newcastle, then suddenly London might have changed hands through a trader who clocked it along the way.

## 5. Inspect the tyres

Tyres are a surprisingly useful clue. A set of quality tyres typically lasts 20,000 to 30,000 miles. If a car supposedly has 25,000 miles on the clock but is wearing its third or fourth set of tyres, the numbers don't work.

Check the tyre brand and age. If the car has cheap budget tyres fitted, it could mean the previous owner replaced worn-out tyres with the cheapest option to prepare the car for sale. Also check the tyre date codes (the four-digit number on the sidewall — e.g., "2224" means week 22 of 2024). If the tyres are relatively new but the car has supposedly been doing low mileage for years, that's worth questioning.

## 6. Examine the exterior and underbody

High-mileage cars pick up stone chips on the bonnet and front bumper from motorway driving. A car that's genuinely done 30,000 miles of mostly local driving should have a relatively chip-free front end. Heavy stone-chipping combined with low claimed mileage is suspicious.

If you can safely look underneath, check for wear on suspension components, exhaust corrosion, and general grime. A genuinely low-mileage car will usually have less wear and buildup than a high-mileage one.

## 7. Get an HPI or provenance check

A paid vehicle history check from providers like HPI, AA, or RAC can flag mileage discrepancies from multiple sources — including finance company records, insurance records, and previous MOT data. These checks cross-reference data that isn't always visible in a basic MOT history lookup.

They'll also tell you if the car has outstanding finance, has been written off, or has been reported stolen — all useful things to know before handing over money.

## 8. Trust your instincts

If a deal looks too good to be true, it probably is. A low-mileage car being sold cheaply, a seller who's evasive about the car's history, a private sale that feels rushed, or a refusal to let you have the car independently inspected — these are all warning signs.

Legitimate sellers are usually happy for you to check the car thoroughly. They'll provide service history, encourage you to run an MOT check, and give you time to make a decision. If the seller is pressuring you to buy quickly or discouraging you from checking the history, walk away.

## What to do if you've bought a clocked car

If you discover after purchase that your car has been clocked, you have legal rights under the Consumer Rights Act 2015 (if you bought from a dealer) or the Misrepresentation Act 1967 (if from a private seller who lied about the mileage).

Steps to take:

- **Gather evidence** — screenshot the MOT history showing the mileage discrepancy, keep all purchase paperwork, save the advert if possible
- **Contact the seller** — formally request a refund, ideally in writing
- **Report it** — contact Action Fraud (0300 123 2040) and your local Trading Standards office
- **Seek advice** — Citizens Advice can help you understand your options if the seller refuses to cooperate

Clocking is a criminal offence under the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008. Sellers who knowingly clock vehicles can face prosecution.

## The bottom line

The easiest way to protect yourself takes about 30 seconds: check the MOT mileage history before you buy. It's free, it's instant, and it catches the vast majority of clocking cases.

Enter any UK reg into [Free Plate Check](/) and look at the mileage recorded at each MOT test. If the readings go steadily up, you can relax. If they jump around or drop — keep looking for a different car.
