The V5C is one of those documents every car owner has but few fully understand. It's often called the "logbook" or "registration document", and while it doesn't prove ownership, it's essential for taxing, selling, and managing your vehicle.

Here's everything you need to know about the V5C.

## What is the V5C?

The V5C — officially called the Vehicle Registration Certificate — is a document issued by the DVLA that records who is the "registered keeper" of a vehicle. It contains key information about the vehicle and the person responsible for it.

Every vehicle registered in the UK has a V5C. It's a multi-page document printed on coloured paper with security features to prevent forgery.

**Important:** The V5C is **not proof of ownership**. It records who the registered keeper is — the person responsible for taxing and insuring the vehicle — but this isn't necessarily the legal owner. A company car, for example, is owned by the company but the V5C may show an employee as the registered keeper.

## What information does the V5C contain?

The V5C records:

- **Registration number** — The vehicle's current number plate
- **Make and model** — e.g. Ford Fiesta, BMW 3 Series
- **Colour** — The recorded body colour
- **Engine size (cc)** — Cubic capacity of the engine
- **Fuel type** — Petrol, diesel, electric, hybrid, etc.
- **VIN (Vehicle Identification Number)** — The unique 17-character code stamped into the vehicle's chassis
- **Date of first registration** — When the vehicle was first registered in the UK
- **Year of manufacture** — When the vehicle was built (can differ from registration date)
- **CO2 emissions** — Recorded emissions figure, used for VED (road tax) calculations
- **Registered keeper's name and address** — The current keeper
- **Previous keeper details** — Limited information about the previous keeper
- **Document reference number** — An 11-digit number needed for online services like taxing the vehicle

You can verify much of this information independently using a [free car check](/car-check) — enter the registration number to see the DVLA data and confirm it matches the V5C.

## Why the V5C matters when buying a car

### Verification

When buying a used car, always ask to see the V5C and check that:

- The **registration number** matches the plates on the car
- The **VIN** matches the number stamped on the vehicle (visible through the windscreen on the dashboard, and on a plate in the door jamb)
- The **make, model, colour, and engine size** match what you can see
- The **registered keeper's name and address** match the seller's details
- The **document isn't suspiciously new** — a recently issued V5C on a car the seller claims to have owned for years is a warning sign

Cross-reference the V5C details with a [free car check](/car-check). If the DVLA data doesn't match the V5C, something is wrong.

### The green "new keeper" slip

The V5C has a detachable green section (V5C/2) called the "new keeper supplement". When you buy a car:

1. The seller fills in the green slip with your details
2. The seller gives you the green slip
3. The seller posts the rest of the V5C to the DVLA (or updates online)
4. The DVLA sends you a new V5C in your name within 2–4 weeks

The green slip lets you tax the vehicle immediately while waiting for your new V5C to arrive. You'll need the 12-digit reference number from the green slip to tax online.

### No V5C? Be cautious

If a private seller cannot produce the V5C, treat this as a significant red flag. Possible explanations include:

- **The seller isn't the registered keeper** — They may not have the right to sell the vehicle.
- **The vehicle may be stolen** — Stolen vehicles are sometimes sold without documentation.
- **There may be outstanding finance** — The finance company may hold the V5C.
- **It's been recently acquired** — The seller may have bought it recently and the V5C hasn't arrived yet. Ask for the green slip as evidence.

A dealer may legitimately not have the V5C if the vehicle was recently traded in, but they should be able to explain the situation and provide it before you collect the car.

## When do you need the V5C?

You'll need your V5C (or its reference number) to:

- **Tax the vehicle** — Online at GOV.UK or at the Post Office. Check your current [tax status](/tax-check).
- **Declare a SORN** — If taking the vehicle off the road
- **Sell the vehicle** — To transfer keeper details to the buyer
- **Transfer a private plate** — The DVLA requires the V5C for plate transfers
- **Scrap the vehicle** — To notify the DVLA through an Authorised Treatment Facility
- **Update your address** — If you move, you must update the V5C within 4 weeks (free)

## How to replace a lost or stolen V5C

If your V5C is lost, stolen, or damaged, you can apply for a replacement:

- **Online** — Through the DVLA's "Get a vehicle log book (V5C)" service. This is the fastest method — you'll usually receive the replacement within 5 working days.
- **By post** — Complete form V62 (available from Post Offices or the DVLA website) and post it to the DVLA. This takes 2–4 weeks.

The replacement costs **£25** whether you apply online or by post.

If the V5C was stolen, report the theft to the police and get a crime reference number before applying for a replacement.

## Common V5C mistakes

**Not updating the address when you move** — You must notify the DVLA of a change of address within 4 weeks. Failure to do so can mean you miss important correspondence, including MOT reminders and penalty notices. Updating is free — do it online at GOV.UK.

**Assuming the V5C proves ownership** — It doesn't. If you're buying a high-value vehicle, the V5C alone is not sufficient proof that the seller is the legal owner. Consider a paid vehicle history check for stolen and finance markers.

**Losing the green slip before taxing** — If you lose the new keeper supplement before taxing the vehicle, you'll need to wait for the full V5C to arrive in your name. Keep the green slip safe until you've taxed the car.

**Sending the V5C to the buyer** — When selling, you send the V5C to the **DVLA**, not to the buyer. The buyer gets the green slip only. The DVLA will issue a new V5C in the buyer's name.

## The bottom line

The V5C is a straightforward document once you understand what it does and doesn't prove. Always check it when buying a car, always update it when selling, and cross-reference the details with a [free car check](/car-check) to make sure everything matches.

If you're about to buy a used car, run a check on the registration number first. It takes 30 seconds and confirms the vehicle details, [MOT history](/mot-check), [tax status](/tax-check), and [mileage records](/mileage-check) — all of which should align with what the V5C shows.
