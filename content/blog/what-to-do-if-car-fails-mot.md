Your car has just failed its MOT. It's frustrating, but it's not the end of the world. Around one in three vehicles fail their MOT each year in the UK, so you're in good company.

Here's what to do next.

## Don't panic — understand the result

When a vehicle fails its MOT, the tester will give you a list of the defects that caused the failure. Since May 2018, these are classified as:

- **Dangerous defects** — An immediate risk to road safety. The vehicle **must not be driven** until the defect is repaired.
- **Major defects** — Serious enough to cause a failure, but not an immediate danger. The vehicle needs repair before it can pass.
- **Minor defects** — Noted on the certificate but do not cause a failure (similar to the old advisory system).

Read the list carefully. If you don't understand a defect, ask the tester to explain it. They should tell you exactly what the problem is, where it is on the vehicle, and what needs to be done to fix it.

You can also look up the full [MOT history](/mot-check) for your vehicle online to see past results, advisories, and how the current failure compares to previous tests.

## Can you drive a car that has failed its MOT?

### If your old MOT hasn't expired yet

Yes. If your current MOT certificate is still valid (you booked the test early), you can continue driving until the existing certificate expires. You must get the repairs done and pass a retest before that date.

### If your MOT has expired

It depends on the defect classification:

- **Dangerous defects** — You **must not drive** the vehicle on any public road. It must be repaired where it is, or transported to a garage on a trailer or flatbed.
- **Major defects only (no dangerous)** — You can drive the vehicle **directly home** from the test centre, but nowhere else. You cannot use it for normal driving until it passes.

In all cases, the vehicle must be insured to drive on any public road.

## Your options after a failure

### Option 1: Get it repaired at the same garage

The simplest approach. If the testing garage also does repairs, they can fix the problems and retest. Many garages offer a free or reduced-cost retest if the work is done at their premises within a set time (usually 10 working days).

**Ask about retest fees upfront.** Some garages charge the full MOT fee again; others offer a partial or free retest for items they've repaired.

### Option 2: Take it elsewhere for repair

You're not obligated to use the testing garage for repairs. If you think the price is too high, or you have a preferred mechanic, you can take the vehicle elsewhere. However:

- You may lose the free/reduced retest offer
- You'll need to book and pay for a full retest at a testing station
- Make sure the vehicle is safe to drive to the other garage (see driving rules above)

### Option 3: Get a second opinion

If you believe the failure was incorrect — for example, you think a component was within limits — you can appeal through the DVSA. You must do this within 14 working days of the test. The DVSA will arrange for an independent examination.

In practice, appeals are rare and most test results stand. But if you genuinely believe the tester made an error, it's your right to challenge it.

### Option 4: Sell or scrap the vehicle

If the repair costs are more than the vehicle is worth, it may make more sense to sell it for salvage or scrap it through an Authorised Treatment Facility. Check our [free car valuation](/car-valuation) to see what the vehicle would be worth in good condition, and weigh that against the repair estimate.

## How to keep retest costs down

### Book your MOT early

You can book your MOT up to one month (minus a day) before the expiry date without losing any time on the new certificate. Booking early means:

- If it fails, you still have your current valid MOT to drive on while arranging repairs
- You're not rushed into expensive same-day repairs
- You have time to shop around for the best repair price

### Get the failure list in writing

The tester must give you a written record of all defects. Take this to other garages for repair quotes. Don't accept the first price you're given.

### Fix it yourself (if you can)

Some failure items are simple enough to fix yourself:

- **Bulbs** — A blown headlight, brake light, or indicator bulb is a common failure that costs a few pounds
- **Wiper blades** — Failing wipers are an easy and cheap replacement
- **Number plate light** — Often just a bulb change
- **Tyre tread depth** — If a tyre is below 1.6mm, you'll need to replace it anyway

For anything involving brakes, steering, suspension, or structural components, leave it to a qualified mechanic.

### Know the free retest rules

If you get the repairs done at the same testing station:

- **Same day or next working day** — The retest is usually free for the specific items that failed
- **Within 10 working days** — A partial retest (only the failed items) is usually free or at a reduced cost
- **After 10 working days** — A full retest at the normal fee applies

These timeframes can vary between garages, so confirm the policy before leaving.

## Common MOT failure reasons

Knowing the most common failures can help you prepare:

1. **Lights and signalling** — Blown bulbs, misaligned headlights, damaged lenses. The single most common failure category.
2. **Suspension** — Worn bushes, damaged shock absorbers, excessive play in joints.
3. **Brakes** — Worn pads or discs, binding calipers, imbalanced braking.
4. **Tyres** — Below minimum tread depth (1.6mm), damage, or incorrect fitment.
5. **Driver's view** — Windscreen chips or cracks in the critical zone, wiper faults.
6. **Exhaust and emissions** — Failed emissions test, exhaust leaks, catalytic converter faults.
7. **Steering** — Excessive play, worn track rod ends, power steering leaks.

Many of these can be spotted before the test. A quick walk-around checking lights, tyres, and wipers can avoid the most common failures.

## The bottom line

Failing an MOT is common and usually fixable. Get the defect list in writing, understand your driving restrictions, shop around for repair quotes, and take advantage of free retest periods. If you booked early, you've got time on your side.

Check your vehicle's full [MOT history](/mot-check) to see whether this year's failures are new issues or recurring problems that should have been addressed earlier. And next year, set a reminder to book a month before the expiry — it makes the whole process less stressful.
