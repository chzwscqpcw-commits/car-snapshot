  - question: "What is an MOT advisory?"
    answer: "An MOT advisory is a note from the tester about an item that isn't bad enough to fail the test but may need attention in the future. It's a warning, not a failure — your car still passes its MOT."
  - question: "Do you need to fix MOT advisories?"
    answer: "You are not legally required to fix MOT advisories. However, advisories often highlight issues that will worsen over time and could become MOT failures at the next test. Addressing them early is usually cheaper than waiting."
  - question: "What is the difference between an MOT advisory and a failure?"
    answer: "A failure means the item does not meet the minimum legal standard and must be repaired before the vehicle can pass. An advisory means the item is deteriorating or borderline but still meets the standard for now."

If you've ever looked at an MOT certificate and spotted a list of "advisories" underneath the pass result, you're not alone in wondering what they actually mean. The good news is that an advisory isn't a fail — but that doesn't mean you should ignore it entirely.

Here's everything you need to know about MOT advisories, in plain English.

## What is an MOT advisory?

An MOT advisory is a note from the tester flagging something that isn't serious enough to fail your car right now, but could become a problem in the future. Think of it as an early warning system.

When your vehicle goes through its MOT, the tester checks dozens of components — brakes, lights, suspension, emissions, steering, bodywork and more. If something is showing signs of wear or minor deterioration but still meets the minimum legal standard, they'll record it as an advisory rather than a failure.

Your car still passes the MOT. You're still legal to drive. But the tester is essentially saying: "Keep an eye on this."

## Advisory vs failure — what's the difference?

The distinction is straightforward:

- **Fail** — The component doesn't meet the minimum standard. Your car fails the MOT and you must fix it before it can pass.
- **Advisory** — The component currently meets the standard, but the tester has noticed wear or deterioration that could lead to a failure in the future.
- **Major fault** — A more serious deficiency that results in a fail.
- **Dangerous fault** — A critical safety issue. The car fails immediately and shouldn't be driven until it's repaired.

Advisories sit at the mild end of this scale. They're informational, not mandatory.

## Common MOT advisory examples

Some advisories come up again and again. Here are a few you're likely to see:

- **"Tyre worn close to the legal limit"** — Your tyres still have enough tread (the legal minimum is 1.6mm), but they're getting close. Worth replacing sooner rather than later.
- **"Brake disc worn, pitted or scored — but not excessively"** — The brake discs are showing normal wear. They still work fine, but they'll need replacing eventually.
- **"Slight corrosion to a brake pipe"** — Surface rust on a brake line. Not dangerous yet, but if left unchecked, corrosion can eat through the pipe entirely.
- **"Oil leak — not excessive"** — A minor oil seep that doesn't pose an immediate risk but should be monitored.
- **"Exhaust has a minor leak"** — The exhaust system has a small leak that doesn't yet affect emissions enough to fail.
- **"Front suspension arm ball joint dust cover deteriorated"** — A rubber boot is cracking. Once it splits, dirt gets in and the joint wears out fast.
- **"Windscreen damage — not in the driver's line of vision"** — A chip or crack that's outside the critical zone directly in front of the driver.

These are all genuine items that MOT testers flag regularly. None of them will fail your car today, but any of them could cause a failure next year if they get worse.

## Do you need to fix MOT advisories?

Legally, no. Your car has passed its MOT and is roadworthy at the time of the test. You're under no obligation to act on advisories.

That said, there are good reasons to take them seriously:

1. **They often become next year's failures.** A "tyre worn close to the limit" advisory this year is almost certainly going to be a fail by your next MOT.
2. **Fixing things early is usually cheaper.** A corroded brake pipe caught early might cost £60 to replace. Left until it fails completely, you're looking at a breakdown, a recovery truck, and a much bigger bill.
3. **Safety matters.** Advisories are flagged because they relate to safety-critical components. Worn brakes and tyres directly affect your ability to stop.
4. **It protects resale value.** A clean MOT history with advisories addressed promptly shows a well-maintained car.

A sensible approach is to prioritise anything related to braking, steering, tyres or suspension — these are safety-critical. Cosmetic advisories or minor items can usually wait, but keep them in mind for your next service.

## How to check your car's advisory history

Every MOT test result since 2005 is recorded and publicly available. You can check a vehicle's full MOT history — including all advisories, failures and passes — by entering the registration number on [Free Plate Check's MOT history tool](/mot-check).

This is particularly useful when buying a used car. Recurring advisories that never get addressed can tell you a lot about how well (or badly) a previous owner maintained the vehicle. For example, if "brake discs worn" has appeared as an advisory for three consecutive years, it suggests the owner has been putting off necessary maintenance.

Look for patterns:

- **The same advisory appearing year after year** — The owner isn't addressing wear items.
- **Mileage that doesn't add up** — If the car has done very few miles between tests, it may have been sitting unused (which brings its own problems).
- **Advisories that escalate to failures** — This shows components that were flagged early but left until they actually failed.

## What to do when you get advisories

1. **Read them carefully.** Make sure you understand what each one means. If you're not sure, ask your garage to explain.
2. **Prioritise safety items.** Brakes, tyres, steering and suspension should be addressed first.
3. **Get a quote.** Ask your mechanic how much it would cost to fix the advisory items. You might be surprised — many are inexpensive if caught early.
4. **Plan ahead.** If you can't fix everything right away, at least know what's coming so you can budget for it before your next MOT.
5. **Keep records.** A history of addressing advisories promptly is a sign of a well-maintained vehicle.

## The bottom line

MOT advisories aren't something to panic about, but they're not something to ignore either. They're your early warning that a component is starting to wear, and addressing them proactively will save you money, keep you safe, and help your car hold its value.

Think of them as your mechanic giving you a heads-up — and act on that advice when you can.
