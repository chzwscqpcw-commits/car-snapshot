If you drive in or around London — or any of the UK's growing number of Clean Air Zones — you need to know whether your car meets the required emission standards. Getting it wrong means a daily charge, and potentially a fine on top.

Here's everything you need to know about ULEZ compliance, how to check your vehicle, and what to do if it doesn't meet the standard.

## What is ULEZ?

ULEZ stands for Ultra Low Emission Zone. It's a designated area where vehicles must meet minimum exhaust emission standards, or the driver pays a daily charge to enter.

London's ULEZ was first introduced in central London in April 2019. It expanded to cover the area within the North and South Circular roads in October 2021, and then in August 2023 it expanded again to cover all London boroughs — essentially the entire Greater London area.

The scheme operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week, every day of the year. It's enforced by automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) cameras, so there's no barrier or checkpoint. If your vehicle doesn't meet the standard and you haven't paid the charge, you'll receive a penalty charge notice in the post.

## What are the emission standards?

Whether your vehicle is compliant depends on its fuel type and the Euro emission standard it was manufactured to:

- **Petrol vehicles** must meet Euro 4 or later. In practice, this covers most petrol cars registered after January 2006, though some models met Euro 4 earlier.
- **Diesel vehicles** must meet Euro 6 or later. This generally means diesel cars registered after September 2015, although again some manufacturers adopted Euro 6 ahead of the mandatory date.

The key word is "generally." The registration date is a useful rule of thumb, but it's not definitive. What matters is the Euro emission standard the vehicle was type-approved to, which can vary by manufacturer and model. A car registered in late 2005 might meet Euro 4; one registered in early 2006 might not, depending on when it was built versus when it was first registered.

This is why checking your specific vehicle is important rather than relying on the date alone.

## Which vehicles are exempt?

Several categories of vehicle are exempt from the ULEZ charge regardless of their emission standard:

- **Electric vehicles** — Fully electric cars produce zero tailpipe emissions and are automatically exempt.
- **Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles** — Like EVs, these produce no exhaust emissions.
- **Historic vehicles** — Vehicles manufactured before 1 January 1973 are exempt. These qualify for the historic vehicle tax class and are not subject to the charge.
- **Disabled tax class vehicles** — Vehicles registered in the disabled tax class are exempt from the ULEZ charge.
- **Military vehicles** — Certain military vehicles are also exempt.

Hybrid vehicles are not automatically exempt. They must still meet the relevant Euro standard for their fuel type (Euro 4 for petrol hybrids, Euro 6 for diesel hybrids). Most modern hybrids will comfortably meet these standards, but older models may not.

## Other UK Clean Air Zones

London's ULEZ gets the most attention, but it's not the only scheme in the UK. Several other cities have introduced Clean Air Zones (CAZs) with their own emission requirements and charges:

- **Birmingham** — A Class D Clean Air Zone covering the city centre, charging non-compliant cars, taxis, vans, buses, coaches, and HGVs.
- **Bath** — A Class C zone that currently charges non-compliant taxis, vans, buses, coaches, and HGVs, though private cars are not charged.
- **Bradford** — A Class C zone focused on commercial vehicles operating in the city centre.
- **Bristol** — A Class D zone in the city centre that includes charges for non-compliant private cars.
- **Oxford** — A Zero Emission Zone in the city centre with stricter requirements that will eventually require all vehicles to be zero-emission.

The emission standards for these zones are broadly similar to ULEZ — Euro 4 for petrol, Euro 6 for diesel — but the charges, boundaries, and vehicle categories vary. If you regularly drive into any of these cities, check the specific rules for that zone.

## What happens if you're non-compliant?

If your vehicle doesn't meet the emission standard and you drive within ULEZ or a Clean Air Zone, you'll need to pay a daily charge:

- **London ULEZ** — The charge is £12.50 per day for cars, motorcycles, and vans (up to 3.5 tonnes). Larger vehicles such as lorries, buses, and coaches that don't meet the standard pay a higher charge under the separate Low Emission Zone scheme.
- **Other Clean Air Zones** — Charges vary by city and vehicle type. Birmingham, for example, charges £8 per day for non-compliant cars.

If you don't pay the charge, you'll receive a Penalty Charge Notice (PCN). In London, this is £180, reduced to £90 if paid within 14 days. Penalties in other zones vary.

The charges apply per day, not per journey. So if you drive in and out of the zone multiple times in a single day, you only pay once — but you do need to pay for each separate day.

## How to check if your car is compliant

The simplest way to check is to look up your vehicle by its registration number:

- **Free Plate Check** — Enter your registration in our [ULEZ compliance checker](/ulez-check) to see your vehicle's emission standard, fuel type, and registration date. This gives you the information you need to determine compliance.
- **TfL ULEZ checker** — Transport for London provides an official checker specifically for the London ULEZ at tfl.gov.uk/modes/driving/check-your-vehicle.
- **Clean Air Zone checkers** — Individual cities with CAZs often have their own checking tools on their council websites.

If you're buying a used car and want to know whether it will be ULEZ compliant before you commit, running a free plate check on the registration is a quick way to find out.

## What to do if your car isn't compliant

If your vehicle doesn't meet the required standard, you have several options:

1. **Retrofit or upgrade the exhaust system.** Some vehicles — particularly vans, minibuses, and coaches — can be retrofitted with approved emission-reduction technology to bring them up to the required standard. This is less common for private cars, but it's worth investigating if you have a newer diesel that narrowly misses Euro 6.

2. **Check for a scrappage or grant scheme.** London has run scrappage schemes in the past that offered grants or payments to help owners of non-compliant vehicles switch to cleaner alternatives. Eligibility criteria apply, and these schemes are subject to funding availability, so check the current position on the TfL website.

3. **Apply for an exemption or discount.** If you think your vehicle qualifies for an exemption — for example, if it's a historic vehicle or registered in the disabled tax class — make sure it's correctly registered. Some exemptions are applied automatically; others require you to apply.

4. **Change your vehicle.** If you regularly drive in a ULEZ or Clean Air Zone, switching to a compliant vehicle may be the most cost-effective option in the long run. Even a modest petrol car from 2006 onwards will typically meet Euro 4, and the daily charge soon adds up if you're driving in the zone frequently.

5. **Avoid the zone.** If you only occasionally drive into a Clean Air Zone, it may be simpler and cheaper to use public transport for those journeys and keep your current vehicle for everything else.

## The bottom line

ULEZ and Clean Air Zones are here to stay, and they're likely to expand further as more cities adopt similar schemes. Knowing whether your car is compliant isn't just about avoiding charges — it helps you plan ahead when it comes to your next vehicle purchase.

A quick check of your registration number is all it takes to find out where you stand. If your car meets the standard, you've got nothing to worry about. If it doesn't, the sooner you know, the more options you have.
