  - question: "Can you check if a car is stolen for free?"
    answer: "There is no free public tool that directly queries the Police National Computer (PNC). However, a free car check can reveal warning signs like mismatched vehicle details, suspicious mileage gaps, or inconsistencies in the MOT history."
  - question: "What happens if you buy a stolen car?"
    answer: "The police will seize the vehicle and you will not be compensated. Under UK law, a thief cannot transfer legal ownership, so even if you bought the car in good faith and paid a fair price, you do not legally own it."
  - question: "How can you tell if a car is stolen?"
    answer: "Warning signs include no V5C logbook, a V5C that doesn't match the seller, only one key, damaged ignition or door locks, tampered VIN plates, the seller insisting on cash, and a price significantly below market value."

Buying a stolen car — even unknowingly — can leave you out of pocket with no legal recourse. The police will seize the vehicle, you won't get your money back from the thief, and your insurance won't cover it. Around 100,000 vehicles are stolen in the UK every year, and a significant number end up in the used car market.

Here's how to reduce the risk before you buy.

## Can you check if a car is stolen for free?

The Police National Computer (PNC) holds records of all vehicles reported stolen in the UK. However, **there is no free public tool** that directly queries this database. The PNC is restricted to law enforcement and authorised organisations.

What you can do for free is use a [free car check](/car-check) to look for warning signs that something isn't right:

- **Vehicle details don't match** — If the make, model, colour, or engine size on the DVLA record doesn't match the car in front of you, walk away immediately.
- **Recently issued V5C** — A brand new V5C on a car that's supposedly been owned for years can indicate a fraudulent logbook.
- **No MOT history** — A vehicle with gaps in its [MOT history](/mot-check) may have been off the road — or the records may belong to a different vehicle.
- **Mileage discrepancies** — Check the [mileage history](/mileage-check) for inconsistencies. Stolen vehicles are sometimes clocked to disguise their identity.

## How to check the PNC for stolen vehicles

To query the PNC directly, you need a paid vehicle history check:

- **HPI Check** — Includes a stolen vehicle check against the PNC. Costs around £20.
- **AA Vehicle Check** — Also queries the PNC for stolen markers.
- **RAC Vehicle History Check** — Comparable coverage.

These services will tell you whether the vehicle has been reported stolen and whether there are any other markers (such as outstanding finance or insurance write-off history).

For any used car purchase over a few hundred pounds, spending £10–£20 on a paid check is sensible. It's the only way to get a definitive answer on stolen status.

## Warning signs of a stolen vehicle

Beyond the data checks, look for these red flags when viewing a car:

### Documentation issues

- **No V5C logbook** — The seller says "it's in the post" or they've lost it. A legitimate seller should have the V5C.
- **V5C details don't match the seller** — The name and address on the V5C should match the person selling the car. If they don't, ask why.
- **Only one key** — Most cars come with two keys when new. A single key could mean the car was taken without access to the spare.

### Physical signs

- **Damaged ignition barrel** — Signs of forced entry around the steering column or ignition.
- **Broken or replaced door locks** — Especially if only one lock looks different from the others.
- **Scratches around the lock cylinders** — Evidence of picking or drilling.
- **VIN plate tampering** — Check the Vehicle Identification Number on the dashboard (visible through the windscreen) and in the door jamb. If either looks scratched, re-stamped, or has different numbers, this is a serious red flag.
- **Window etching doesn't match** — Some vehicles have the registration number etched into the windows. If this doesn't match the plates on the car, something is wrong.

### Behavioural red flags

- **Seller wants cash only** — Insisting on cash and refusing a bank transfer removes the paper trail.
- **Meeting in a car park** — A legitimate private seller should be happy to meet at their home address, which should match the V5C.
- **Price too good to be true** — A car priced significantly below market value should raise questions about why.
- **Rushing the sale** — Pressure to decide quickly, view in the dark, or skip normal checks.
- **No test drive allowed** — A seller who won't let you drive the car may not want you spending too long with it.

## What happens if you buy a stolen car?

### The police will seize it

If the police identify a vehicle as stolen — whether through a routine ANPR check, a traffic stop, or an insurance investigation — they will seize it. You will not be compensated.

### You have no legal ownership

Under UK law, a thief cannot pass on legal ownership. Even if you bought the car in good faith, paid a fair price, and have a receipt, you do not legally own it. The original owner (or their insurer) retains the title.

This is different from the rules around outstanding finance, where an innocent buyer can sometimes gain good title under the Hire Purchase Act 1964. With stolen vehicles, there is no such protection.

### Your options are limited

- **Report it to the police** — Cooperate fully and provide all details about the sale.
- **Claim against the seller** — If you can identify and locate the seller, you may be able to pursue a civil claim. In practice, this is often impossible.
- **Check your insurance** — Some comprehensive insurance policies cover the purchase of a stolen vehicle, but this is rare. Check your policy wording.

## How to protect yourself

**Run a paid vehicle history check** on any car costing more than a few hundred pounds. The £20 is insignificant compared to the risk.

**Start with a free check.** Use our [free car check](/car-check) to verify the DVLA data, [MOT history](/mot-check), [tax status](/tax-check), and [mileage records](/mileage-check). Any discrepancies should stop you going further.

**Always view at the seller's home address.** The address should match the V5C. If the seller wants to meet elsewhere, ask why.

**Check the VIN.** Compare the VIN on the dashboard, the door jamb, and the V5C. All three should match exactly.

**Pay by bank transfer.** This creates a record of the transaction linked to a real bank account.

**Get a receipt.** Include the seller's full name, address, the registration number, VIN, agreed price, and date. Both parties should sign it.

**Trust your instincts.** If anything feels wrong — the price, the seller's behaviour, the documentation — walk away. There are always other cars.

## The bottom line

A stolen vehicle check is one of the few things a free car check can't fully cover, because the PNC database isn't publicly accessible. For peace of mind on any significant purchase, add a £20 paid check from HPI, AA, or RAC.

But always start with a [free car check](/car-check) — it covers vehicle details, [MOT history](/mot-check), [mileage verification](/mileage-check), [tax status](/tax-check), [ULEZ compliance](/ulez-check), [safety recalls](/recall-check), and [valuation](/car-valuation). That's a comprehensive first screen that costs nothing and takes 30 seconds.
