Missing your MOT expiry date is easier than you'd think. There's no reminder letter from the DVLA, no notification through the post, and no grace period. One day your MOT is valid, the next it isn't — and if you're still driving, you're breaking the law.

Here's how to check when your MOT is due and make sure you never miss it.

## How to check your MOT due date

The quickest way is to enter your registration number on our [MOT check tool](/mot-check). You'll see your current MOT status, the expiry date, and the full test history.

You can also check on the GOV.UK website, but our tool shows you everything in one place — MOT history, tax status, mileage records, and vehicle details — so you get the full picture at a glance.

## When does a car need an MOT?

In the UK, most vehicles need their first MOT when they're **three years old**. After that, they need a new MOT every 12 months.

The three-year rule is based on the date of first registration, not the date of manufacture. If a car was built in 2022 but first registered on 15 June 2023, its first MOT is due by 14 June 2026.

Some vehicles have different rules:

- **Taxis and ambulances** — Need an MOT after one year, not three
- **Historic vehicles** — Cars manufactured before 1 January 1977 are exempt from MOT testing entirely
- **Electric vehicles** — Still need an MOT, but the emissions test is obviously not applicable

## Can you get your MOT done early?

Yes. You can have your MOT done up to **one month (minus a day) before the expiry date** without losing any time on the new certificate.

For example, if your current MOT expires on 20 April, you can have the new test done from 21 March onwards. The new certificate will still run until 20 April the following year — you don't lose the remaining days.

This is the smart approach. Booking your MOT a few weeks early means:

- You have time to shop around for the best price
- If the car fails, you have time to arrange repairs and a retest before the old certificate expires
- You're not scrambling at the last minute

If you get your MOT done **more than** a month early, the new certificate starts from the date of the test rather than the old expiry date. So you'd effectively lose whatever time was left on the old certificate.

## What happens if your MOT expires?

### You can't legally drive

Once your MOT expires, you cannot drive the vehicle on any public road — with one exception: you can drive directly to a **pre-booked** MOT appointment, as long as the vehicle is insured and the route is direct.

### You can't tax the vehicle

The DVLA won't let you renew your [road tax](/tax-check) without a valid MOT. If your MOT and tax both expire, you'll need to get the MOT sorted first, then tax the vehicle before driving normally.

### Insurance may be affected

Some insurance policies include a condition that the vehicle must have a valid MOT. If you're involved in an accident while driving without an MOT, your insurer might refuse to pay out. Check your policy wording — the financial consequences of an uninsured accident far outweigh the cost of an MOT.

### You won't be fined automatically

Unlike tax, the DVLA doesn't issue automatic penalties for an expired MOT. However, if you're caught driving without one — whether by police, ANPR cameras, or during a routine stop — you can be fined up to **£1,000**.

## How to never miss your MOT

### Set a calendar reminder

The simplest approach. Check your [MOT expiry date](/mot-check), then set a reminder in your phone for one month before. When the reminder goes off, book the test.

### Use a reminder service

Several free services will email or text you when your MOT is approaching. Your garage may also offer a reminder service — ask next time you visit.

### Link it to another annual event

If your MOT is due in March, link it mentally to something you won't forget — the start of spring, the clocks changing, the end of the tax year. Pairing it with an existing habit makes it harder to overlook.

### Book your next MOT immediately after passing

Some garages will let you book next year's MOT before you leave. This locks in the date and means you don't have to think about it again for 11 months.

## What does the MOT test cover?

The MOT tests your vehicle against a set of minimum safety and environmental standards. Key areas include:

- **Lights and signals** — All lights must work and be correctly aimed
- **Steering and suspension** — No excessive play or wear
- **Brakes** — Must meet minimum efficiency standards
- **Tyres** — At least 1.6mm tread depth, no significant damage
- **Bodywork and structure** — No sharp edges or excessive corrosion affecting structural integrity
- **Exhaust and emissions** — Must meet the relevant emission standard
- **Windscreen and wipers** — No significant damage in the driver's line of sight
- **Seatbelts** — All fitted belts must work correctly
- **Mirrors** — Must be present and in usable condition

The test takes around 45–60 minutes and the maximum fee is £54.85 for a car (though many garages charge less).

You can see exactly what was checked, passed, and flagged at every previous test by looking at the [full MOT history](/mot-check) for any vehicle.

## The bottom line

Your MOT due date is easy to check and easy to forget. Take 30 seconds to [look it up](/mot-check) now, set a reminder for a month before, and book with time to spare. It's a small habit that keeps you legal, keeps you safe, and avoids the stress of a last-minute scramble.
