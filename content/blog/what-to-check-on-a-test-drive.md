A test drive is your best opportunity to discover problems that no amount of online checks can reveal. Mechanical issues, unusual noises, poor handling, and electrical faults only show up when the car is moving. Yet many buyers treat the test drive as a formality, driving around the block and declaring it "fine."

Here's a systematic checklist to follow so you don't miss anything.

## Before the test drive

### Do your homework first

Before you even view the car, run a [free car check](/car-check) to review:

- **[MOT history](/mot-check)** — Look for recurring failures or advisories, especially on brakes, suspension, and steering. These tell you what's likely to go wrong.
- **[Mileage records](/mileage-check)** — Check for consistency. If the odometer doesn't match the MOT history, walk away.
- **[Tax status](/tax-check)** — An untaxed vehicle shouldn't be on the road, and driving it on a test drive is technically illegal.
- **[Safety recalls](/recall-check)** — Any outstanding recalls should be addressed before purchase.

### Plan your route

Don't let the seller dictate the route. Plan a 15–20 minute drive that includes:

- **A quiet residential street** — For low-speed checks (steering, clutch, first impressions)
- **A dual carriageway or A-road** — For higher-speed assessment (engine, vibrations, wind noise)
- **A bumpy or uneven road** — To test suspension, listen for rattles, and feel for handling issues
- **Hills** — To test engine power under load and check the handbrake
- **Stop-start traffic** — To check the clutch, gearbox, and brakes under normal urban conditions

## Starting up

### Cold start is essential

Ask to start the car from cold. A warm engine masks many problems. If you arrive and the engine is already warm, the seller may have run it beforehand to hide a difficult cold start.

**Check for:**
- **Difficulty starting** — Excessive cranking, rough idle, or the need for multiple attempts
- **Smoke from the exhaust** — A puff of blue smoke on startup indicates oil burning. White smoke that persists after warming up suggests a head gasket issue. Black smoke points to a fuelling problem.
- **Warning lights** — Every dashboard light should illuminate briefly when you turn the ignition on, then go off. If any stay on (especially engine management, oil, or ABS), there's a problem.
- **Unusual noises** — Tapping, knocking, or rattling from the engine at idle

### Before moving off

While stationary with the engine running:

- **Check the idle** — Should be smooth and steady, typically 600–800 RPM
- **Test the handbrake** — Pull it on, put the car in gear (or Drive), and gently release the clutch/brake. The car should not move.
- **Test all electrics** — Windows, mirrors, air conditioning, heater, radio, seats (if electric), sunroof. Electrical faults are expensive to fix.
- **Check the clutch** — (Manual cars) Find the biting point. If it's very high (near the top of the pedal travel), the clutch may be worn.

## On the road

### Engine

- **Power delivery** — Accelerate through the rev range in each gear. The engine should pull smoothly without hesitation, flat spots, or misfires.
- **Response** — There should be no significant delay between pressing the accelerator and the car responding. Turbo lag is normal on turbocharged engines, but excessive hesitation is not.
- **Temperature** — The gauge should settle in the middle of the range and stay there. If it climbs towards the red, there may be a cooling system problem.
- **Unusual noises under load** — Knocking or pinking (a metallic rattling under acceleration) can indicate serious engine problems.

### Gearbox

**Manual:**
- **Every gear should engage smoothly** — Crunchiness or resistance when shifting indicates synchromesh wear
- **Reverse** — Should engage without grinding. Some gearboxes are notchy into reverse from cold, which is normal, but persistent grinding is not.
- **Clutch slip** — In a high gear at low speed, press the accelerator firmly. If the revs rise but the car doesn't accelerate proportionally, the clutch is slipping.

**Automatic:**
- **Smooth shifts** — You should barely feel gear changes. Harsh shifts, slipping, or delays indicate transmission problems.
- **Kickdown** — Press the accelerator firmly and the gearbox should quickly downshift for overtaking. Hesitation or jerking is a concern.
- **Creep** — In Drive with your foot on the brake, the car should gently pull forward. This is normal and indicates the torque converter is working.

### Brakes

- **Stopping power** — Find a safe, quiet stretch of road and brake firmly from 30–40 mph. The car should stop in a straight line with no juddering, pulling to one side, or unusual noise.
- **Pedal feel** — The brake pedal should feel firm and progressive. A spongy pedal suggests air in the hydraulic system. A pedal that sinks to the floor indicates a serious problem.
- **Noise** — Squealing can indicate worn brake pads. A grinding noise means the pads are worn down to metal and the discs may be damaged too.
- **ABS** — If the car has ABS (all modern cars do), you should feel a pulsing through the pedal during hard braking. The ABS light should not be on during normal driving.

### Steering

- **Centre tracking** — On a straight, flat road, briefly relax your grip. The car should continue straight without pulling to either side.
- **Response** — The steering should feel direct and responsive with no excessive play (looseness around the centre).
- **Vibrations** — Vibration through the steering wheel at speed usually indicates wheel balancing issues or worn suspension components.
- **Power steering** — Turn the wheel fully in both directions. There should be no groaning, whining, or stiffness. Check for power steering fluid leaks underneath the car afterwards.
- **Full lock** — Turn fully in both directions. Listen for clicking — on front-wheel-drive cars, clicking on full lock indicates worn CV joints.

### Suspension

- **Bump absorption** — The car should handle bumps and potholes without excessive bouncing, crashing, or bottoming out.
- **Body roll** — Some roll in corners is normal, but excessive lean suggests worn anti-roll bar links or shock absorbers.
- **Noises** — Clunking or knocking over bumps points to worn bushings, drop links, or ball joints. These are MOT failure items.
- **Uneven feel** — If the car feels different over the left and right wheels, one side may have worn components.

### At speed (dual carriageway)

- **Vibrations** — Any vibration through the steering wheel, seat, or pedals at motorway speed (60–70 mph) needs investigation. Could be wheel balance, tyres, driveshaft, or brake disc issues.
- **Wind noise** — Excessive noise from door seals suggests worn or damaged weatherstripping. Check around the windscreen too.
- **Road noise** — Some tyre noise is normal, but excessive roar could indicate worn or mismatched tyres.
- **Stability** — The car should feel planted and stable. Wandering or vagueness at speed is a concern.

## After the test drive

### Under the bonnet

With the engine warm, open the bonnet and check:

- **Oil** — Pull the dipstick. Oil should be between the marks, honey-coloured (petrol) or dark (diesel is normal). Milky or mayonnaise-like residue on the oil filler cap can indicate a head gasket problem.
- **Coolant** — Check the expansion tank level (do NOT open when hot). The coolant should be the correct colour (usually pink, blue, or green), not brown or oily.
- **Leaks** — Look underneath the car for any fresh fluid spots. Oil, coolant, power steering fluid, or brake fluid leaks are all concerns.

### Under the car

Crouch down and look underneath for:

- **Rust** — Surface rust is normal on older cars, but structural rust on the chassis, sills, or subframe is a potential MOT failure and expensive to repair.
- **Exhaust condition** — Check for holes, excessive rust, or hanging sections.
- **Fluid leaks** — Fresh spots under the engine, gearbox, or differential areas.

## Walk-away warning signs

These should stop the purchase unless reflected in a significantly reduced price:

- Engine management light stays on
- Blue or white smoke from the exhaust after the engine has warmed up
- Gearbox crunches or won't engage gears
- Brakes pull to one side or pedal feels spongy
- Excessive vibration at any speed
- Mayonnaise-like residue in the oil or coolant
- Seller won't let you test drive or restricts the route
- Mileage on the dash doesn't match the [MOT records](/mileage-check)

## The bottom line

A thorough test drive takes 20–30 minutes and can save you thousands in unexpected repairs. Don't feel rushed, don't be afraid to point out issues, and don't let enthusiasm for the car override your judgement.

Before viewing any car, run a [free car check](/car-check) to review the [MOT history](/mot-check), [mileage trail](/mileage-check), [tax status](/tax-check), [recall history](/recall-check), and [estimated value](/car-valuation). Arrive informed, test systematically, and trust what the car tells you on the road.
