A car's service history is one of the most important things to check when buying used. It tells you whether the vehicle has been properly maintained, gives clues about how it's been treated, and directly affects its value. A car with a full service history is typically worth 10–20% more than an identical car without one.

Here's how to check it and what to look for.

## What is a full service history (FSH)?

A full service history means the car has been serviced at the correct intervals throughout its life, with documented evidence of each service. This usually means:

- **Annual services or services at the manufacturer's recommended mileage intervals** (whichever comes first)
- **A stamp or digital record for each service** with the date, mileage, and work done
- **No significant gaps** between services

"Full dealer service history" (FDSH) means all services were carried out by a franchised dealer for that brand. "Full service history" on its own may include a mix of dealer and independent garage services — both are acceptable, though FDSH typically carries a slight premium.

## Where to find service history records

### Physical service book

Most cars come with a physical service booklet that gets stamped at each service. This is the traditional record and is still widely used. Check that:

- Every stamp includes a **date, mileage, and garage details**
- The **mileage increases logically** between services
- The **stamps look genuine** — consistent ink, proper garage details, not obviously added after the fact

### Digital service records

Many manufacturers now use online service records instead of physical books. These are harder to forge and easier to verify:

- **BMW** — Connected Drive service history
- **Volkswagen Group** (VW, Audi, Skoda, Seat) — Digital service schedule
- **Mercedes** — Mercedes me service records
- **Ford** — Motorcraft online service history

Ask the seller which system was used and verify directly with the manufacturer's portal or by calling a franchised dealer with the registration number.

### MOT history as a backup

If the service book is missing, the [MOT history](/mot-check) provides useful clues. Each MOT test records the mileage, so you can track whether the car has been driven reasonable distances between tests. Large gaps in mileage or inconsistencies can indicate problems.

Use our [mileage check](/mileage-check) to see the complete mileage trail from MOT records.

## Red flags to watch for

### Missing service book

"I've lost the service book" is a common excuse. While it's possible, a missing book means you have no proof of maintenance. This should be reflected in a lower price — and you should verify what you can through other means.

### Gaps in the record

A car serviced every year for five years and then nothing for two years raises questions. What happened during that gap? Was the car off the road? Did the owner stop maintaining it? Gaps often coincide with the period where expensive maintenance is due.

### Suspiciously low mileage between services

If the service book shows 3,000 miles in a year but the car is a daily driver, the mileage may have been tampered with. Cross-reference with the [MOT mileage history](/mileage-check) to check for discrepancies.

### Services done by the owner

"Serviced by owner" stamps or handwritten notes have no verification value. Anyone can write "oil changed" in a book. Independent garage stamps with verifiable business details are the minimum acceptable standard.

### Recent service just before sale

A service carried out the week before listing the car for sale — especially after a long gap — can be an attempt to make the history look better than it is. Check what was actually done. A basic oil change doesn't make up for years of neglect.

## What a service should include

A standard annual service typically covers:

- **Engine oil and filter change**
- **Air filter inspection or replacement**
- **Brake fluid check**
- **Coolant level check**
- **Tyre condition and pressure check**
- **Lights and electrical systems check**
- **Brake pad and disc inspection**

A major service (usually every 2 years or 24,000 miles) adds:

- **Spark plug replacement** (petrol engines)
- **Fuel filter replacement** (diesel engines)
- **Transmission fluid check or change**
- **Cabin/pollen filter replacement**
- **More detailed brake and suspension inspection**

Some items are age/mileage-specific: timing belt replacement (typically every 5 years or 60,000–100,000 miles), brake fluid change (every 2 years), and coolant change (every 5 years). Check whether these have been done.

## How service history affects value

Service history has a direct impact on what a car is worth. Use our [free valuation tool](/car-valuation) to get a baseline estimate, then consider:

- **Full dealer service history** — Adds 10–20% to the value versus no history
- **Full service history (independent garages)** — Adds 5–15%
- **Partial service history** — Some evidence is better than none, but expect a discount
- **No service history** — Significant price reduction. Budget for a thorough inspection and any catch-up maintenance

## How to verify service history

**1. Call the garages listed.** Phone the service centres stamped in the book and ask them to confirm the car was serviced on the dates shown. Legitimate businesses will have records.

**2. Check the MOT mileage trail.** Use our [free car check](/car-check) to see the mileage recorded at each MOT. This should broadly match the service book entries.

**3. Ask for invoices.** Receipts for parts and labour provide additional evidence beyond the service book stamps.

**4. Check for manufacturer recalls.** Use our [recall check](/recall-check) to see if any outstanding safety recalls have been addressed — a well-maintained car will have had recalls dealt with promptly.

**5. Look at the car itself.** A well-serviced car shows it. Clean oil on the dipstick, no warning lights on the dashboard, smooth engine idle, and good brake feel all suggest proper maintenance.

## The bottom line

Service history is the single best indicator of how a car has been treated. Always ask to see it before committing to a purchase, and take the time to verify what you're shown.

Start with a [free car check](/car-check) to review the [MOT history](/mot-check), [mileage records](/mileage-check), [tax status](/tax-check), and [safety recalls](/recall-check). Then cross-reference the service book entries with the MOT mileage trail to build a complete picture of the car's maintenance history.
