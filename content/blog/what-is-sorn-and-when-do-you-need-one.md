If you're taking a car off the road — whether it's a project car sitting in your garage, a vehicle you can't afford to run right now, or a car waiting to be sold — you need to know about SORN. Getting it wrong can result in fines, and the rules aren't always as obvious as you'd expect.

Here's the plain-English version.

## What does SORN stand for?

SORN stands for Statutory Off Road Notification. It's a formal declaration to the DVLA that your vehicle is not being used or kept on a public road.

Once a SORN is in place, you don't need to tax or insure the vehicle (though many people choose to keep insurance for fire and theft). The trade-off is that the vehicle cannot be driven or parked on any public road — not even for a minute.

## When do you need a SORN?

You need to make a SORN declaration if:

- **Your vehicle tax has expired** and you're not going to renew it
- **You're keeping a car off the road** for any reason — repairs, storage, not using it over winter, waiting to sell it
- **You've bought a car** that you're not going to use straight away
- **The vehicle isn't roadworthy** and needs work before it can pass an MOT

The key rule is simple: if a vehicle is registered in your name and it isn't taxed, it must be SORN'd. There's no middle ground. An untaxed vehicle without a SORN is illegal, even if it's parked on your own driveway that happens to be accessible from a public road.

## How to make a SORN declaration

You can SORN a vehicle online through the DVLA's website. You'll need the V5C (logbook) reference number. It's free and takes a couple of minutes.

You can also do it by post using the V890 form, or by phone. The online route is by far the quickest.

Once declared, the SORN stays in place until you tax the vehicle again. You don't need to renew it annually — it's a one-off declaration that lasts indefinitely.

## Where can you keep a SORN'd vehicle?

A SORN'd vehicle must be kept on private land at all times. This means:

- **Your driveway or garage** — Fine, as long as it's private property
- **A private car park** — Fine, if you have permission to store it there
- **A rented storage unit or compound** — Fine
- **The public road outside your house** — Not fine. Even if you live on a quiet residential street, the road is public. Your SORN'd vehicle cannot be there.

This is the rule that catches most people out. If your driveway is full and you leave a SORN'd car on the street, the DVLA can issue a fine and potentially have the vehicle removed.

## What happens if you don't SORN?

If your vehicle's tax expires and you haven't made a SORN declaration, the DVLA will send you a late licensing penalty — currently £80. If you ignore that, it can escalate to court proceedings and a fine of up to £1,000.

The DVLA's systems are automated. When your tax expires, their database checks whether you've renewed or declared SORN. If neither has happened, the penalty is generated automatically. It's not a case of "they might notice" — it's virtually guaranteed.

On top of that, untaxed vehicles on public roads can be clamped or impounded. You'll then need to pay release fees, which start at £100 for the clamp plus £25 per day for storage. If you don't claim the vehicle within a set period, it can be crushed or sold.

## Can you drive a SORN'd vehicle?

No. A SORN'd vehicle cannot be driven on any public road for any reason. Not to the shops, not to a friend's house, not "just round the corner."

There is one narrow exception: you can drive to a pre-booked MOT appointment, but only if the vehicle is insured. The route must be direct — you can't make stops along the way. And if the vehicle fails its MOT, you can drive it directly home or to a garage for repairs (again, insured and by the most direct route).

For any other journey, the vehicle must be taxed and insured before its wheels touch a public road. This means taxing it online before you set off, not "when you get home."

## SORN and buying or selling a car

### Buying a SORN'd vehicle

If you buy a car that's currently SORN'd, you must tax and insure it before driving it on any public road. You cannot rely on the seller's SORN — it doesn't transfer. You can check whether a vehicle is currently SORN'd by looking up its registration number with our [free tax status checker](/tax-check). The tax status will show as "SORN" if one is in place.

If the car is being delivered to you on a trailer or transporter, you don't need to tax it immediately. But the moment you want to drive it yourself, tax and insurance must be in place.

### Selling a SORN'd vehicle

If you're selling a vehicle that's SORN'd, make sure the buyer understands they can't drive it away without taxing and insuring it first. Many private sales fall apart over this — the buyer turns up expecting to drive the car home but can't because it's not taxed.

Be upfront in your advert. Stating "currently SORN'd, buyer will need to tax before driving" avoids wasted time for everyone.

## Does a SORN cancel your insurance?

Making a SORN declaration doesn't automatically cancel your insurance — you'll need to do that separately if you want to. However, many people choose to keep at least third-party, fire and theft cover on a SORN'd vehicle, especially if it's stored outside.

If your car is stolen from your driveway or damaged by fire while SORN'd and uninsured, you'll have no cover. Comprehensive storage insurance is relatively cheap and worth considering for anything of value.

## How to take a vehicle off SORN

When you're ready to use the vehicle again, simply tax it through the DVLA. Taxing the vehicle automatically cancels the SORN — you don't need to do anything extra.

Remember: you'll need a valid MOT certificate before you can tax the vehicle (unless it's exempt). So the typical sequence is:

1. Insure the vehicle
2. Drive directly to a pre-booked MOT
3. Pass the MOT
4. Tax the vehicle online
5. Drive normally

## The key points

- SORN is mandatory if your vehicle isn't taxed and isn't being used on the road
- It's free and lasts indefinitely until you re-tax
- The vehicle must stay on private land — no public roads
- Fines for getting it wrong are automatic and start at £80
- You can drive to a pre-booked MOT only, and only if insured
- SORN doesn't transfer when a car is bought or sold

It's straightforward once you know the rules, and five minutes spent making a SORN declaration can save you from an unwelcome letter from the DVLA.
