If your car has failed its MOT and you believe the result is wrong, you have the right to appeal. The process is straightforward but time-sensitive — you have just 14 working days to lodge an appeal, and the vehicle must not be repaired before the appeal inspection.

Here's how it works and when it's worth doing.

## When can you appeal an MOT failure?

You can appeal if you believe:

- **The vehicle was tested incorrectly** — The tester applied the wrong standard, used faulty equipment, or made an error in judgement
- **A failure item doesn't actually exist** — The fault listed on the failure notice isn't present on the vehicle
- **The item shouldn't have been a failure** — It's a borderline case and you believe it should have been an advisory rather than a failure

You **cannot** appeal simply because you disagree with the result in general, or because another garage says they would have passed it. The appeal examines whether the testing standards were correctly applied at the time of the test.

## The appeal process step by step

### 1. Do NOT repair the vehicle

This is critical. If you repair or modify the vehicle before the appeal inspection, your appeal will be invalid. The DVSA examiner needs to see the car in the same condition as when it was tested.

The only exception is if the car is dangerous to drive — in which case you should arrange for the DVSA to inspect it at its current location.

### 2. Contact the DVSA within 14 working days

You must lodge your appeal within **14 working days** of the MOT test date. Contact the DVSA (Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency):

- **Phone:** 0300 123 9000
- **Email:** Contact via the GOV.UK website
- **Online:** Through the DVSA's appeals service on GOV.UK

When you call or write, have ready:
- The MOT test number (from the failure document)
- The vehicle registration number
- The specific items you're disputing and why

### 3. DVSA arranges an inspection

A DVSA examiner — independent of the original test centre — will inspect the vehicle. This can happen at:

- **A local DVSA test centre**
- **The original MOT station** (if the vehicle can't be moved)
- **Your location** (if the vehicle is undriveable)

The inspection focuses only on the disputed items. The examiner will assess whether the original tester applied the MOT testing standards correctly.

### 4. The outcome

There are three possible results:

- **Appeal upheld** — The DVSA agrees the vehicle should not have failed on the disputed items. If this changes the overall result to a pass, a new MOT certificate is issued.
- **Appeal partially upheld** — Some disputed items are overturned, but others stand. If the remaining items are still failures, the vehicle still fails.
- **Appeal rejected** — The DVSA agrees with the original tester. The failure stands.

The appeal inspection is **free** — you don't pay anything regardless of the outcome.

## What about the test centre?

If your appeal is upheld, the DVSA will investigate the test centre. Depending on the severity and pattern of errors, action can range from:

- A conversation with the tester about standards
- Additional training requirements
- Disciplinary action
- In serious cases, withdrawal of the station's testing authorisation

You don't need to take any action against the test centre yourself — the DVSA handles this.

## When is it worth appealing?

### Good reasons to appeal

- **The failure item genuinely doesn't exist** — For example, the notice says "excessive corrosion to nearside sill" but the sill is solid. This is a clear-cut case.
- **The tester applied the wrong standard** — Different rules apply to vehicles of different ages and types. If your car was held to the wrong standard, that's grounds for appeal.
- **The measurement seems wrong** — If the failure is based on a measurement (like tyre tread depth or brake efficiency) and you have evidence the measurement is incorrect.
- **The wrong vehicle was tested** — Rare, but if details on the failure notice don't match your vehicle, something has gone wrong.

### Situations where an appeal probably isn't worth it

- **The failure is legitimate but borderline** — If your brake pads are at 1.5mm and the limit is 1.5mm, they may have been just under at the time of test. Getting them replaced is quicker and cheaper than appealing.
- **The repair is cheap and quick** — If the failure item is a blown bulb or a minor tyre issue, the cost and time of repairing it is far less than waiting for an appeal.
- **You've already repaired the vehicle** — Once repaired, you can't appeal. Just book a retest.
- **You just disagree** — If another garage says they'd have passed it, that doesn't mean the first tester was wrong. Both could be applying the standards correctly — some items are genuinely borderline.

## The retest option

If you don't want to appeal (or the appeal fails), you have the right to a retest:

### Free partial retest

If you return to **the same test centre** within **10 working days**, you're entitled to a free retest on the failure items only. The rest of the vehicle doesn't need to be retested.

### Paid full retest

If you go to a **different test centre** or more than 10 working days have passed, you'll need to pay for a full MOT test (currently up to £54.85 for a car).

### Comparison

| Option | Cost | Timeframe | Best for |
|--------|------|-----------|----------|
| Appeal | Free | Up to 14 working days to lodge | Genuine errors by the tester |
| Free retest (same centre) | Free | Within 10 working days | Failure items you can fix quickly |
| Full retest (any centre) | Up to £54.85 | Any time | When you want a fresh opinion |

## How to avoid disputes in the first place

### Check the MOT history before booking

Use our [MOT check](/mot-check) to review previous test results. Look for:

- **Recurring advisories** that might have progressed to failures
- **Items that failed last time** that may not have been properly repaired
- **Pattern of issues** that suggest ongoing problems with specific components

This helps you anticipate what might fail and address it beforehand.

### Choose a reputable test centre

Look for MOT centres with:

- Consistent, long-standing operation
- Good reviews
- Transparent pricing for retests and repairs
- A willingness to explain findings

Avoid centres that offer suspiciously cheap MOTs or pressure you into having repairs done on-site immediately after a failure.

### Consider a pre-MOT check

Many garages offer a pre-MOT inspection for £20–£40. They'll check the common failure points and advise what needs attention before the actual test. This reduces the chance of an unexpected failure.

## How to check your current MOT status

Use our [free car check](/car-check) to see:

- **Current MOT status** and expiry date
- **Full MOT test history** with every pass, failure, and advisory
- **Mileage recorded** at each test
- **Failure reasons** and advisory notices from previous tests

This gives you a complete picture of the vehicle's testing history and helps you prepare for future tests.

## The bottom line

MOT appeals exist for genuine errors, and the process is free and straightforward. The key constraints are the 14-working-day deadline and the requirement not to repair the vehicle before inspection.

For most people, the practical approach is to get the failure items repaired and return for a free retest within 10 working days at the same centre. Reserve appeals for cases where you genuinely believe the tester got it wrong.

Check your vehicle's complete [MOT history](/mot-check) with our [free car check](/car-check) to understand the pattern of tests and prepare for what comes next.
